<h1>IN THE CAGE</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>It had occurred to her early that in her position&mdash;that of a
young person spending, in framed and wired confinement, the life of
a guinea-pig or a magpie&mdash;she should know a great many persons
without their recognising the acquaintance.&nbsp; That made it an emotion
the more lively&mdash;though singularly rare and always, even then,
with opportunity still very much smothered&mdash;to see any one come
in whom she knew outside, as she called it, any one who could add anything
to the meanness of her function.&nbsp; Her function was to sit there
with two young men&mdash;the other telegraphist and the counter-clerk;
to mind the &ldquo;sounder,&rdquo; which was always going, to dole out
stamps and postal-orders, weigh letters, answer stupid questions, give
difficult change and, more than anything else, count words as numberless
as the sands of the sea, the words of the telegrams thrust, from morning
to night, through the gap left in the high lattice, across the encumbered
shelf that her forearm ached with rubbing.&nbsp; This transparent screen
fenced out or fenced in, according to the side of the narrow counter
on which the human lot was cast, the duskiest corner of a shop pervaded
not a little, in winter, by the poison of perpetual gas, and at all
times by the presence of hams, cheese, dried fish, soap, varnish, paraffin
and other solids and fluids that she came to know perfectly by their
smells without consenting to know them by their names.</p>
<p>The barrier that divided the little post-and-telegraph-office from
the grocery was a frail structure of wood and wire; but the social,
the professional separation was a gulf that fortune, by a stroke quite
remarkable, had spared her the necessity of contributing at all publicly
to bridge.&nbsp; When Mr. Cocker&rsquo;s young men stepped over from
behind the other counter to change a five-pound note&mdash;and Mr. Cocker&rsquo;s
situation, with the cream of the &ldquo;Court Guide&rdquo; and the dearest
furnished apartments, Simpkin&rsquo;s, Ladle&rsquo;s, Thrupp&rsquo;s,
just round the corner, was so select that his place was quite pervaded
by the crisp rustle of these emblems&mdash;she pushed out the sovereigns
as if the applicant were no more to her than one of the momentary, the
practically featureless, appearances in the great procession; and this
perhaps all the more from the very fact of the connexion (only recognised
outside indeed) to which she had lent herself with ridiculous inconsequence.&nbsp;
She recognised the others the less because she had at last so unreservedly,
so irredeemably, recognised Mr. Mudge.&nbsp; However that might be,
she was a little ashamed of having to admit to herself that Mr. Mudge&rsquo;s
removal to a higher sphere&mdash;to a more commanding position, that
is, though to a much lower neighbourhood&mdash;would have been described
still better as a luxury than as the mere simplification, the corrected
awkwardness, that she contented herself with calling it.&nbsp; He had
at any rate ceased to be all day long in her eyes, and this left something
a little fresh for them to rest on of a Sunday.&nbsp; During the three
months of his happy survival at Cocker&rsquo;s after her consent to
their engagement she had often asked herself what it was marriage would
be able to add to a familiarity that seemed already to have scraped
the platter so clean.&nbsp; Opposite there, behind the counter of which
his superior stature, his whiter apron, his more clustering curls and
more present, too present, <i>h</i>&rsquo;s had been for a couple of
years the principal ornament, he had moved to and fro before her as
on the small sanded floor of their contracted future.&nbsp; She was
conscious now of the improvement of not having to take her present and
her future at once.&nbsp; They were about as much as she could manage
when taken separate.</p>
<p>She had, none the less, to give her mind steadily to what Mr. Mudge
had again written her about, the idea of her applying for a transfer
to an office quite similar&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t yet hope for a place
in a bigger&mdash;under the very roof where he was foreman, so that,
dangled before her every minute of the day, he should see her, as he
called it, &ldquo;hourly,&rdquo; and in a part, the far N.W. district,
where, with her mother, she would save on their two rooms alone nearly
three shillings.&nbsp; It would be far from dazzling to exchange Mayfair
for Chalk Farm, and it wore upon her much that he could never drop a
subject; still, it didn&rsquo;t wear as things <i>had</i> worn, the
worries of the early times of their great misery, her own, her mother&rsquo;s
and her elder sister&rsquo;s&mdash;the last of whom had succumbed to
all but absolute want when, as conscious and incredulous ladies, suddenly
bereft, betrayed, overwhelmed, they had slipped faster and faster down
the steep slope at the bottom of which she alone had rebounded.&nbsp;
Her mother had never rebounded any more at the bottom than on the way;
had only rumbled and grumbled down and down, making, in respect of caps,
topics and &ldquo;habits,&rdquo; no effort whatever&mdash;which simply
meant smelling much of the time of whiskey.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>It was always rather quiet at Cocker&rsquo;s while the contingent
from Ladle&rsquo;s and Thrupp&rsquo;s and all the other great places
were at luncheon, or, as the young men used vulgarly to say, while the
animals were feeding.&nbsp; She had forty minutes in advance of this
to go home for her own dinner; and when she came back and one of the
young men took his turn there was often half an hour during which she
could pull out a bit of work or a book&mdash;a book from the place where
she borrowed novels, very greasy, in fine print and all about fine folks,
at a ha&rsquo;penny a day.&nbsp; This sacred pause was one of the numerous
ways in which the establishment kept its finger on the pulse of fashion
and fell into the rhythm of the larger life.&nbsp; It had something
to do, one day, with the particular flare of importance of an arriving
customer, a lady whose meals were apparently irregular, yet whom she
was destined, she afterwards found, not to forget.&nbsp; The girl was
blas&eacute;e; nothing could belong more, as she perfectly knew, to
the intense publicity of her profession; but she had a whimsical mind
and wonderful nerves; she was subject, in short, to sudden flickers
of antipathy and sympathy, red gleams in the grey, fitful needs to notice
and to &ldquo;care,&rdquo; odd caprices of curiosity.&nbsp; She had
a friend who had invented a new career for women&mdash;that of being
in and out of people&rsquo;s houses to look after the flowers.&nbsp;
Mrs. Jordan had a manner of her own of sounding this allusion; &ldquo;the
flowers,&rdquo; on her lips, were, in fantastic places, in happy homes,
as usual as the coals or the daily papers.&nbsp; She took charge of
them, at any rate, in all the rooms, at so much a month, and people
were quickly finding out what it was to make over this strange burden
of the pampered to the widow of a clergyman.&nbsp; The widow, on her
side, dilating on the initiations thus opened up to her, had been splendid
to her young friend, over the way she was made free of the greatest
houses&mdash;the way, especially when she did the dinner-tables, set
out so often for twenty, she felt that a single step more would transform
her whole social position.&nbsp; On its being asked of her then if she
circulated only in a sort of tropical solitude, with the upper servants
for picturesque natives, and on her having to assent to this glance
at her limitations, she had found a reply to the girl&rsquo;s invidious
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no imagination, my dear!&rdquo;&mdash;that
was because a door more than half open to the higher life couldn&rsquo;t
be called anything but a thin partition.&nbsp; Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s imagination
quite did away with the thickness.</p>
<p>Our young lady had not taken up the charge, had dealt with it good-humouredly,
just because she knew so well what to think of it.&nbsp; It was at once
one of her most cherished complaints and most secret supports that people
didn&rsquo;t understand her, and it was accordingly a matter of indifference
to her that Mrs. Jordan shouldn&rsquo;t; even though Mrs. Jordan, handed
down from their early twilight of gentility and also the victim of reverses,
was the only member of her circle in whom she recognised an equal.&nbsp;
She was perfectly aware that her imaginative life was the life in which
she spent most of her time; and she would have been ready, had it been
at all worth while, to contend that, since her outward occupation didn&rsquo;t
kill it, it must be strong indeed.&nbsp; Combinations of flowers and
green-stuff, forsooth!&nbsp; What <i>she</i> could handle freely, she
said to herself, was combinations of men and women.&nbsp; The only weakness
in her faculty came from the positive abundance of her contact with
the human herd; this was so constant, it had so the effect of cheapening
her privilege, that there were long stretches in which inspiration,
divination and interest quite dropped.&nbsp; The great thing was the
flashes, the quick revivals, absolute accidents all, and neither to
be counted on nor to be resisted.&nbsp; Some one had only sometimes
to put in a penny for a stamp and the whole thing was upon her.&nbsp;
She was so absurdly constructed that these were literally the moments
that made up&mdash;made up for the long stiffness of sitting there in
the stocks, made up for the cunning hostility of Mr. Buckton and the
importunate sympathy of the counter-clerk, made up for the daily deadly
flourishy letter from Mr. Mudge, made up even for the most haunting
of her worries, the rage at moments of not knowing how her mother did
&ldquo;get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had surrendered herself moreover of late to a certain expansion
of her consciousness; something that seemed perhaps vulgarly accounted
for by the fact that, as the blast of the season roared louder and the
waves of fashion tossed their spray further over the counter, there
were more impressions to be gathered and really&mdash;for it came to
that&mdash;more life to be led.&nbsp; Definite at any rate it was that
by the time May was well started the kind of company she kept at Cocker&rsquo;s
had begun to strike her as a reason&mdash;a reason she might almost
put forward for a policy of procrastination.&nbsp; It sounded silly,
of course, as yet, to plead such a motive, especially as the fascination
of the place was after all a sort of torment.&nbsp; But she liked her
torment; it was a torment she should miss at Chalk Farm.&nbsp; She was
ingenious and uncandid, therefore, about leaving the breadth of London
a little longer between herself and that austerity.&nbsp; If she hadn&rsquo;t
quite the courage in short to say to Mr. Mudge that her actual chance
for a play of mind was worth any week the three shillings he desired
to help her to save, she yet saw something happen in the course of the
month that in her heart of hearts at least answered the subtle question.&nbsp;
This was connected precisely with the appearance of the memorable lady.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>She pushed in three bescribbled forms which the girl&rsquo;s hand
was quick to appropriate, Mr. Buckton having so frequent a perverse
instinct for catching first any eye that promised the sort of entertainment
with which she had her peculiar affinity.&nbsp; The amusements of captives
are full of a desperate contrivance, and one of our young friend&rsquo;s
ha&rsquo;pennyworths had been the charming tale of &ldquo;Picciola.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was of course the law of the place that they were never to take no
notice, as Mr. Buckton said, whom they served; but this also never prevented,
certainly on the same gentleman&rsquo;s own part, what he was fond of
describing as the underhand game.&nbsp; Both her companions, for that
matter, made no secret of the number of favourites they had among the
ladies; sweet familiarities in spite of which she had repeatedly caught
each of them in stupidities and mistakes, confusions of identity and
lapses of observation that never failed to remind her how the cleverness
of men ends where the cleverness of women begins.&nbsp; &ldquo;Marguerite,
Regent Street.&nbsp; Try on at six.&nbsp; All Spanish lace.&nbsp; Pearls.&nbsp;
The full length.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was the first; it had no signature.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lady Agnes Orme, Hyde Park Place.&nbsp; Impossible to-night,
dining Haddon.&nbsp; Opera to-morrow, promised Fritz, but could do play
Wednesday.&nbsp; Will try Haddon for Savoy, and anything in the world
you like, if you can get Gussy.&nbsp; Sunday Montenero.&nbsp; Sit Mason
Monday, Tuesday.&nbsp; Marguerite awful.&nbsp; Cissy.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
was the second.&nbsp; The third, the girl noted when she took it, was
on a foreign form: &ldquo;Everard, H&ocirc;tel Brighton, Paris.&nbsp;
Only understand and believe.&nbsp; 22nd to 26th, and certainly 8th and
9th.&nbsp; Perhaps others.&nbsp; Come.&nbsp; Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was very handsome, the handsomest woman, she felt in a moment,
she had ever seen&mdash;or perhaps it was only Cissy.&nbsp; Perhaps
it was both, for she had seen stranger things than that&mdash;ladies
wiring to different persons under different names.&nbsp; She had seen
all sorts of things and pieced together all sorts of mysteries.&nbsp;
There had once been one&mdash;not long before&mdash;who, without winking,
sent off five over five different signatures.&nbsp; Perhaps these represented
five different friends who had asked her&mdash;all women, just as perhaps
now Mary and Cissy, or one or other of them, were wiring by deputy.&nbsp;
Sometimes she put in too much&mdash;too much of her own sense; sometimes
she put in too little; and in either case this often came round to her
afterwards, for she had an extraordinary way of keeping clues.&nbsp;
When she noticed she noticed; that was what it came to.&nbsp; There
were days and days, there were weeks sometimes, of vacancy.&nbsp; This
arose often from Mr. Buckton&rsquo;s devilish and successful subterfuges
for keeping her at the sounder whenever it looked as if anything might
arouse; the sounder, which it was equally his business to mind, being
the innermost cell of captivity, a cage within the cage, fenced oft
from the rest by a frame of ground glass.&nbsp; The counter-clerk would
have played into her hands; but the counter-clerk was really reduced
to idiocy by the effect of his passion for her.&nbsp; She flattered
herself moreover, nobly, that with the unpleasant conspicuity of this
passion she would never have consented to be obliged to him.&nbsp; The
most she would ever do would be always to shove off on him whenever
she could the registration of letters, a job she happened particularly
to loathe.&nbsp; After the long stupors, at all events, there almost
always suddenly would come a sharp taste of something; it was in her
mouth before she knew it; it was in her mouth now.</p>
<p>To Cissy, to Mary, whichever it was, she found her curiosity going
out with a rush, a mute effusion that floated back to her, like a returning
tide, the living colour and splendour of the beautiful head, the light
of eyes that seemed to reflect such utterly other things than the mean
things actually before them; and, above all, the high curt consideration
of a manner that even at bad moments was a magnificent habit and of
the very essence of the innumerable things&mdash;her beauty, her birth,
her father and mother, her cousins and all her ancestors&mdash;that
its possessor couldn&rsquo;t have got rid of even had she wished.&nbsp;
How did our obscure little public servant know that for the lady of
the telegrams this was a bad moment?&nbsp; How did she guess all sorts
of impossible things, such as, almost on the very spot, the presence
of drama at a critical stage and the nature of the tie with the gentleman
at the H&ocirc;tel Brighton?&nbsp; More than ever before it floated
to her through the bars of the cage that this at last was the high reality,
the bristling truth that she had hitherto only patched up and eked out&mdash;one
of the creatures, in fine, in whom all the conditions for happiness
actually met, and who, in the air they made, bloomed with an unwitting
insolence.&nbsp; What came home to the girl was the way the insolence
was tempered by something that was equally a part of the distinguished
life, the custom of a flowerlike bend to the less fortunate&mdash;a
dropped fragrance, a mere quick breath, but which in fact pervaded and
lingered.&nbsp; The apparition was very young, but certainly married,
and our fatigued friend had a sufficient store of mythological comparison
to recognise the port of Juno.&nbsp; Marguerite might be &ldquo;awful,&rdquo;
but she knew how to dress a goddess.</p>
<p>Pearls and Spanish lace&mdash;she herself, with assurance, could
see them, and the &ldquo;full length&rdquo; too, and also red velvet
bows, which, disposed on the lace in a particular manner (she could
have placed them with the turn of a hand) were of course to adorn the
front of a black brocade that would be like a dress in a picture.&nbsp;
However, neither Marguerite nor Lady Agnes nor Haddon nor Fritz nor
Gussy was what the wearer of this garment had really come in for.&nbsp;
She had come in for Everard&mdash;and that was doubtless not his true
name either.&nbsp; If our young lady had never taken such jumps before
it was simply that she had never before been so affected.&nbsp; She
went all the way.&nbsp; Mary and Cissy had been round together, in their
single superb person, to see him&mdash;he must live round the corner;
they had found that, in consequence of something they had come, precisely,
to make up for or to have another scene about, he had gone off&mdash;gone
off just on purpose to make them feel it; on which they had come together
to Cocker&rsquo;s as to the nearest place; where they had put in the
three forms partly in order not to put in the one alone.&nbsp; The two
others in a manner, covered it, muffled it, passed it off.&nbsp; Oh
yes, she went all the way, and this was a specimen of how she often
went.&nbsp; She would know the hand again any time.&nbsp; It was as
handsome and as everything else as the woman herself.&nbsp; The woman
herself had, on learning his flight, pushed past Everard&rsquo;s servant
and into his room; she had written her missive at his table and with
his pen.&nbsp; All this, every inch of it, came in the waft that she
blew through and left behind her, the influence that, as I have said,
lingered.&nbsp; And among the things the girl was sure of, happily,
was that she should see her again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>She saw her in fact, and only ten days later; but this time not alone,
and that was exactly a part of the luck of it.&nbsp; Not unaware&mdash;as
how could her observation have left her so?&mdash;of the possibilities
through which it could range, our young lady had ever since had in her
mind a dozen conflicting theories about Everard&rsquo;s type; as to
which, the instant they came into the place, she felt the point settled
with a thump that seemed somehow addressed straight to her heart.&nbsp;
That organ literally beat faster at the approach of the gentleman who
was this time with Cissy, and who, as seen from within the cage, became
on the spot the happiest of the happy circumstances with which her mind
had invested the friend of Fritz and Gussy.&nbsp; He was a very happy
circumstance indeed as, with his cigarette in his lips and his broken
familiar talk caught by his companion, he put down the half-dozen telegrams
it would take them together several minutes to dispatch.&nbsp; And here
it occurred, oddly enough, that if, shortly before the girl&rsquo;s
interest in his companion had sharpened her sense for the messages then
transmitted, her immediate vision of himself had the effect, while she
counted his seventy words, of preventing intelligibility.&nbsp; His
words were mere numbers, they told her nothing whatever; and after he
had gone she was in possession of no name, of no address, of no meaning,
of nothing but a vague sweet sound and an immense impression.&nbsp;
He had been there but five minutes, he had smoked in her face, and,
busy with his telegrams, with the tapping pencil and the conscious danger,
the odious betrayal that would come from a mistake, she had had no wandering
glances nor roundabout arts to spare.&nbsp; Yet she had taken him in;
she knew everything; she had made up her mind.</p>
<p>He had come back from Paris; everything was re-arranged; the pair
were again shoulder to shoulder in their high encounter with life, their
large and complicated game.&nbsp; The fine soundless pulse of this game
was in the air for our young woman while they remained in the shop.&nbsp;
While they remained?&nbsp; They remained all day; their presence continued
and abode with her, was in everything she did till nightfall, in the
thousands of other words she counted, she transmitted, in all the stamps
she detached and the letters she weighed and the change she gave, equally
unconscious and unerring in each of these particulars, and not, as the
run on the little office thickened with the afternoon hours, looking
up at a single ugly face in the long sequence, nor really hearing the
stupid questions that she patiently and perfectly answered.&nbsp; All
patience was possible now, all questions were stupid after his, all
faces were ugly.&nbsp; She had been sure she should see the lady again;
and even now she should perhaps, she should probably, see her often.&nbsp;
But for him it was totally different; she should never never see him.&nbsp;
She wanted it too much.&nbsp; There was a kind of wanting that helped&mdash;she
had arrived, with her rich experience, at that generalisation; and there
was another kind that was fatal.&nbsp; It was this time the fatal kind;
it would prevent.</p>
<p>Well, she saw him the very next day, and on this second occasion
it was quite different; the sense of every syllable he paid for was
fiercely distinct; she indeed felt her progressive pencil, dabbing as
if with a quick caress the marks of his own, put life into every stroke.&nbsp;
He was there a long time&mdash;had not brought his forms filled out
but worked them off in a nook on the counter; and there were other people
as well&mdash;a changing pushing cluster, with every one to mind at
once and endless right change to make and information to produce.&nbsp;
But she kept hold of him throughout; she continued, for herself, in
a relation with him as close as that in which, behind the hated ground
glass, Mr. Buckton luckily continued with the sounder.&nbsp; This morning
everything changed, but rather to dreariness; she had to swallow the
rebuff to her theory about fatal desires, which she did without confusion
and indeed with absolute levity; yet if it was now flagrant that he
did live close at hand&mdash;at Park Chambers&mdash;and belonged supremely
to the class that wired everything, even their expensive feelings (so
that, as he never wrote, his correspondence cost him weekly pounds and
pounds, and he might be in and out five times a day) there was, all
the same, involved in the prospect, and by reason of its positive excess
of light, a perverse melancholy, a gratuitous misery.&nbsp; This was
at once to give it a place in an order of feelings on which I shall
presently touch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for a month, he was very constant.&nbsp; Cissy, Mary,
never re-appeared with him; he was always either alone or accompanied
only by some gentleman who was lost in the blaze of his glory.&nbsp;
There was another sense, however&mdash;and indeed there was more than
one&mdash;in which she mostly found herself counting in the splendid
creature with whom she had originally connected him.&nbsp; He addressed
this correspondent neither as Mary nor as Cissy; but the girl was sure
of whom it was, in Eaten Square, that he was perpetually wiring to&mdash;and
all so irreproachably!&mdash;as Lady Bradeen.&nbsp; Lady Bradeen was
Cissy, Lady Bradeen was Mary, Lady Bradeen was the friend of Fritz and
of Gussy, the customer of Marguerite, and the close ally in short (as
was ideally right, only the girl had not yet found a descriptive term
that was) of the most magnificent of men.&nbsp; Nothing could equal
the frequency and variety of his communications to her ladyship but
their extraordinary, their abysmal propriety.&nbsp; It was just the
talk&mdash;so profuse sometimes that she wondered what was left for
their real meetings&mdash;of the very happiest people.&nbsp; Their real
meetings must have been constant, for half of it was appointments and
allusions, all swimming in a sea of other allusions still, tangled in
a complexity of questions that gave a wondrous image of their life.&nbsp;
If Lady Bradeen was Juno it was all certainly Olympian.&nbsp; If the
girl, missing the answers, her ladyship&rsquo;s own outpourings, vainly
reflected that Cocker&rsquo;s should have been one of the bigger offices
where telegrams arrived as well as departed, there were yet ways in
which, on the whole, she pressed the romance closer by reason of the
very quantity of imagination it demanded and consumed.&nbsp; The days
and hours of this new friend, as she came to account him, were at all
events unrolled, and however much more she might have known she would
still have wished to go beyond.&nbsp; In fact she did go beyond; she
went quite far enough.</p>
<p>But she could none the less, even after a month, scarce have told
if the gentlemen who came in with him recurred or changed; and this
in spite of the fact that they too were always posting and wiring, smoking
in her face and signing or not signing.&nbsp; The gentlemen who came
in with him were nothing when he was there.&nbsp; They turned up alone
at other times&mdash;then only perhaps with a dim richness of reference.&nbsp;
He himself, absent as well as present, was all.&nbsp; He was very tall,
very fair, and had, in spite of his thick preoccupations, a good-humour
that was exquisite, particularly as it so often had the effect of keeping
him on.&nbsp; He could have reached over anybody, and anybody&mdash;no
matter who&mdash;would have let him; but he was so extraordinarily kind
that he quite pathetically waited, never waggling things at her out
of his turn nor saying &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; with horrid sharpness.&nbsp;
He waited for pottering old ladies, for gaping slaveys, for the perpetual
Buttonses from Thrupp&rsquo;s; and the thing in all this that she would
have liked most unspeakably to put to the test was the possibility of
her having for him a personal identity that might in a particular way
appeal.&nbsp; There were moments when he actually struck her as on her
side, as arranging to help, to support, to spare her.</p>
<p>But such was the singular spirit of our young friend that she could
remind herself with a pang that when people had awfully good manners&mdash;people
of that class,&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; These manners were
for everybody, and it might be drearily unavailing for any poor particular
body to be overworked and unusual.&nbsp; What he did take for granted
was all sorts of facility; and his high pleasantness, his relighting
of cigarettes while he waited, his unconscious bestowal of opportunities,
of boons, of blessings, were all a part of his splendid security, the
instinct that told him there was nothing such an existence as his could
ever lose by.&nbsp; He was somehow all at once very bright and very
grave, very young and immensely complete; and whatever he was at any
moment it was always as much as all the rest the mere bloom of his beatitude.&nbsp;
He was sometimes Everard, as he had been at the H&ocirc;tel Brighton,
and he was sometimes Captain Everard.&nbsp; He was sometimes Philip
with his surname and sometimes Philip without it.&nbsp; In some directions
he was merely Phil, in others he was merely Captain.&nbsp; There were
relations in which he was none of these things, but a quite different
person&mdash;&ldquo;the Count.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were several friends
for whom he was William.&nbsp; There were several for whom, in allusion
perhaps to his complexion, he was &ldquo;the Pink &lsquo;Un.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Once, once only by good luck, he had, coinciding comically, quite miraculously,
with another person also near to her, been &ldquo;Mudge.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yes, whatever he was, it was a part of his happiness&mdash;whatever
he was and probably whatever he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And his happiness
was a part&mdash;it became so little by little&mdash;of something that,
almost from the first of her being at Cocker&rsquo;s, had been deeply
with the girl.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>This was neither more nor less than the queer extension of her experience,
the double life that, in the cage, she grew at last to lead.&nbsp; As
the weeks went on there she lived more and more into the world of whiffs
and glimpses, she found her divinations work faster and stretch further.&nbsp;
It was a prodigious view as the pressure heightened, a panorama fed
with facts and figures, flushed with a torrent of colour and accompanied
with wondrous world-music.&nbsp; What it mainly came to at this period
was a picture of how London could amuse itself; and that, with the running
commentary of a witness so exclusively a witness, turned for the most
part to a hardening of the heart.&nbsp; The nose of this observer was
brushed by the bouquet, yet she could never really pluck even a daisy.&nbsp;
What could still remain fresh in her daily grind was the immense disparity,
the difference and contrast, from class to class, of every instant and
every motion.&nbsp; There were times when all the wires in the country
seemed to start from the little hole-and-corner where she plied for
a livelihood, and where, in the shuffle of feet, the flutter of &ldquo;forms,&rdquo;
the straying of stamps and the ring of change over the counter, the
people she had fallen into the habit of remembering and fitting together
with others, and of having her theories and interpretations of, kept
up before her their long procession and rotation.&nbsp; What twisted
the knife in her vitals was the way the profligate rich scattered about
them, in extravagant chatter over their extravagant pleasures and sins,
an amount of money that would have held the stricken household of her
frightened childhood, her poor pinched mother and tormented father and
lost brother and starved sister, together for a lifetime.&nbsp; During
her first weeks she had often gasped at the sums people were willing
to pay for the stuff they transmitted&mdash;the &ldquo;much love&rdquo;s,
the &ldquo;awful&rdquo; regrets, the compliments and wonderments and
vain vague gestures that cost the price of a new pair of boots.&nbsp;
She had had a way then of glancing at the people&rsquo;s faces, but
she had early learnt that if you became a telegraphist you soon ceased
to be astonished.&nbsp; Her eye for types amounted nevertheless to genius,
and there were those she liked and those she hated, her feeling for
the latter of which grew to a positive possession, an instinct of observation
and detection.&nbsp; There were the brazen women, as she called them,
of the higher and the lower fashion, whose squanderings and graspings,
whose struggles and secrets and love-affairs and lies, she tracked and
stored up against them till she had at moments, in private, a triumphant
vicious feeling of mastery and ease, a sense of carrying their silly
guilty secrets in her pocket, her small retentive brain, and thereby
knowing so much more about them than they suspected or would care to
think.&nbsp; There were those she would have liked to betray, to trip
up, to bring down with words altered and fatal; and all through a personal
hostility provoked by the lightest signs, by their accidents of tone
and manner, by the particular kind of relation she always happened instantly
to feel.</p>
<p>There were impulses of various kinds, alternately soft and severe,
to which she was constitutionally accessible and which were determined
by the smallest accidents.&nbsp; She was rigid in general on the article
of making the public itself affix its stamps, and found a special enjoyment
in dealing to that end with some of the ladies who were too grand to
touch them.&nbsp; She had thus a play of refinement and subtlety greater,
she flattered herself, than any of which she could be made the subject;
and though most people were too stupid to be conscious of this it brought
her endless small consolations and revenges.&nbsp; She recognised quite
as much those of her sex whom she would have liked to help, to warn,
to rescue, to see more of; and that alternative as well operated exactly
through the hazard of personal sympathy, her vision for silver threads
and moonbeams and her gift for keeping the clues and finding her way
in the tangle.&nbsp; The moonbeams and silver threads presented at moments
all the vision of what poor <i>she</i> might have made of happiness.&nbsp;
Blurred and blank as the whole thing often inevitably, or mercifully,
became, she could still, through crevices and crannies, be stupefied,
especially by what, in spite of all seasoning, touched the sorest place
in her consciousness, the revelation of the golden shower flying about
without a gleam of gold for herself.&nbsp; It remained prodigious to
the end, the money her fine friends were able to spend to get still
more, or even to complain to fine friends of their own that they were
in want.&nbsp; The pleasures they proposed were equalled only by those
they declined, and they made their appointments often so expensively
that she was left wondering at the nature of the delights to which the
mere approaches were so paved with shillings.&nbsp; She quivered on
occasion into the perception of this and that one whom she would on
the chance have just simply liked to <i>be</i>.&nbsp; Her conceit, her
baffled vanity, was possibly monstrous; she certainly often threw herself
into a defiant conviction that she would have done the whole thing much
better.&nbsp; But her greatest comfort, mostly, was her comparative
vision of the men; by whom I mean the unmistakeable gentlemen, for she
had no interest in the spurious or the shabby and no mercy at all for
the poor.&nbsp; She could have found a sixpence, outside, for an appearance
of want; but her fancy, in some directions so alert, had never a throb
of response for any sign of the sordid.&nbsp; The men she did track,
moreover, she tracked mainly in one relation, the relation as to which
the cage convinced her, she believed, more than anything else could
have done, that it was quite the most diffused.</p>
<p>She found her ladies, in short, almost always in communication with
her gentlemen, and her gentlemen with her ladies, and she read into
the immensity of their intercourse stories and meanings without end.&nbsp;
Incontestably she grew to think that the men cut the best figure; and
in this particular, as in many others, she arrived at a philosophy of
her own, all made up of her private notations and cynicisms.&nbsp; It
was a striking part of the business, for example, that it was much more
the women, on the whole, who were after the men than the men who were
after the women: it was literally visible that the general attitude
of the one sex was that of the object pursued and defensive, apologetic
and attenuating, while the light of her own nature helped her more or
less to conclude as to the attitude of the other.&nbsp; Perhaps she
herself a little even fell into the custom of pursuit in occasionally
deviating only for gentlemen from her high rigour about the stamps.&nbsp;
She had early in the day made up her mind, in fine, that they had the
best manners; and if there were none of them she noticed when Captain
Everard was there, there were plenty she could place and trace and name
at other times, plenty who, with their way of being &ldquo;nice&rdquo;
to her, and of handling, as if their pockets were private tills loose
mixed masses of silver and gold, were such pleasant appearances that
she could envy them without dislike.&nbsp; <i>They</i> never had to
give change&mdash;they only had to get it.&nbsp; They ranged through
every suggestion, every shade of fortune, which evidently included indeed
lots of bad luck as well as of good, declining even toward Mr. Mudge
and his bland firm thrift, and ascending, in wild signals and rocket-flights,
almost to within hail of her highest standard.&nbsp; So from month to
month she went on with them all, through a thousand ups and downs and
a thousand pangs and indifferences.&nbsp; What virtually happened was
that in the shuffling herd that passed before her by far the greater
part only passed&mdash;a proportion but just appreciable stayed.&nbsp;
Most of the elements swam straight away, lost themselves in the bottomless
common, and by so doing really kept the page clear.&nbsp; On the clearness
therefore what she did retain stood sharply out; she nipped and caught
it, turned it over and interwove it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>She met Mrs. Jordan when she could, and learned from her more and
more how the great people, under her gentle shake and after going through
everything with the mere shops, were waking up to the gain of putting
into the hands of a person of real refinement the question that the
shop-people spoke of so vulgarly as that of the floral decorations.&nbsp;
The regular dealers in these decorations were all very well; but there
was a peculiar magic in the play of taste of a lady who had only to
remember, through whatever intervening dusk, all her own little tables,
little bowls and little jars and little other arrangements, and the
wonderful thing she had made of the garden of the vicarage.&nbsp; This
small domain, which her young friend had never seen, bloomed in Mrs.
Jordan&rsquo;s discourse like a new Eden, and she converted the past
into a bank of violets by the tone in which she said &ldquo;Of course
you always knew my one passion!&rdquo;&nbsp; She obviously met now,
at any rate, a big contemporary need, measured what it was rapidly becoming
for people to feel they could trust her without a tremor.&nbsp; It brought
them a peace that&mdash;during the quarter of an hour before dinner
in especial&mdash;was worth more to them than mere payment could express.&nbsp;
Mere payment, none the less, was tolerably prompt; she engaged by the
month, taking over the whole thing; and there was an evening on which,
in respect to our heroine, she at last returned to the charge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing and growing, and I see that I must really
divide the work.&nbsp; One wants an associate&mdash;of one&rsquo;s own
kind, don&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp; You know the look they want it all
to have?&mdash;of having come, not from a florist, but from one of themselves.&nbsp;
Well, I&rsquo;m sure <i>you</i> could give it&mdash;because you <i>are</i>
one.&nbsp; Then we <i>should</i> win.&nbsp; Therefore just come in with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave the P.O.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the P.O. simply bring you your letters.&nbsp; It would
bring you lots, you&rsquo;d see: orders, after a bit, by the score.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was on this, in due course, that the great advantage again came up:
&ldquo;One seems to live again with one&rsquo;s own people.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It had taken some little time (after their having parted company in
the tempest of their troubles and then, in the glimmering dawn, finally
sighted each other again) for each to admit that the other was, in her
private circle, her only equal, but the admission came, when it did
come, with an honest groan; and since equality was named, each found
much personal profit in exaggerating the other&rsquo;s original grandeur.&nbsp;
Mrs. Jordan was ten years the older, but her young friend was struck
with the smaller difference this now made: it had counted otherwise
at the time when, much more as a friend of her mother&rsquo;s, the bereaved
lady, without a penny of provision and with stopgaps, like their own,
all gone, had, across the sordid landing on which the opposite doors
of the pair of scared miseries opened and to which they were bewilderedly
bolted, borrowed coals and umbrellas that were repaid in potatoes and
postage-stamps.&nbsp; It had been a questionable help, at that time,
to ladies submerged, floundering, panting, swimming for their lives,
that they were ladies; but such an advantage could come up again in
proportion as others vanished, and it had grown very great by the time
it was the only ghost of one they possessed.&nbsp; They had literally
watched it take to itself a portion of the substance of each that had
departed; and it became prodigious now, when they could talk of it together,
when they could look back at it across a desert of accepted derogation,
and when, above all, they could together work up a credulity about it
that neither could otherwise work up.&nbsp; Nothing was really so marked
as that they felt the need to cultivate this legend much more after
having found their feet and stayed their stomachs in the ultimate obscure
than they had done in the upper air of mere frequent shocks.&nbsp; The
thing they could now oftenest say to each other was that they knew what
they meant; and the sentiment with which, all round, they knew it was
known had well-nigh amounted to a promise not again to fall apart.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan was at present fairly dazzling on the subject of the
way that, in the practice of her fairy art, as she called it, she more
than peeped in&mdash;she penetrated.&nbsp; There was not a house of
the great kind&mdash;and it was of course only a question of those,
real homes of luxury&mdash;in which she was not, at the rate such people
now had things, all over the place.&nbsp; The girl felt before the picture
the cold breath of disinheritance as much as she had ever felt it in
the cage; she knew moreover how much she betrayed this, for the experience
of poverty had begun, in her life, too early, and her ignorance of the
requirements of homes of luxury had grown, with other active knowledge,
a depth of simplification.&nbsp; She had accordingly at first often
found that in these colloquies she could only pretend she understood.&nbsp;
Educated as she had rapidly been by her chances at Cocker&rsquo;s, there
were still strange gaps in her learning&mdash;she could never, like
Mrs. Jordan, have found her way about one of the &ldquo;homes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Little by little, however, she had caught on, above all in the light
of what Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s redemption had materially made of that lady,
giving her, though the years and the struggles had naturally not straightened
a feature, an almost super-eminent air.&nbsp; There were women in and
out of Cocker&rsquo;s who were quite nice and who yet didn&rsquo;t look
well; whereas Mrs. Jordan looked well and yet, with her extraordinarily
protrusive teeth, was by no means quite nice.&nbsp; It would seem, mystifyingly,
that it might really come from all the greatness she could live with.&nbsp;
It was fine to hear her talk so often of dinners of twenty and of her
doing, as she said, exactly as she liked with them.&nbsp; She spoke
as if, for that matter, she invited the company.&nbsp; &ldquo;They simply
give me the table&mdash;all the rest, all the other effects, come afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Then you <i>do</i> see them?&rdquo; the girl again asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan hesitated, and indeed the point had been ambiguous before.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you mean the guests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her young friend, cautious about an undue exposure of innocence,
was not quite sure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well&mdash;the people who live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Ventnor?&nbsp; Mrs. Bubb?&nbsp; Lord Rye?&nbsp; Dear,
yes.&nbsp; Why they <i>like</i> one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But does one personally <i>know</i> them?&rdquo; our young
lady went on, since that was the way to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean socially,
don&rsquo;t you know?&mdash;as you know <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not so nice as you!&rdquo; Mrs. Jordan charmingly
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I <i>shall</i> see more and more of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah this was the old story.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why almost any day.&nbsp; Of course,&rdquo; Mrs. Jordan honestly
added, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re nearly always out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do they want flowers all over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that doesn&rsquo;t make any difference.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs.
Jordan was not philosophic; she was just evidently determined it <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i>
make any.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re awfully interested in my ideas,
and it&rsquo;s inevitable they should meet me over them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her interlocutress was sturdy enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you call
your ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s reply was fine.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you were to see
me some day with a thousand tulips you&rsquo;d discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand?&rdquo;&mdash;the girl gaped at such a revelation
of the scale of it; she felt for the instant fairly planted out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, but if in fact they never do meet you?&rdquo; she none
the less pessimistically insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never?&nbsp; They <i>often</i> do&mdash;and evidently quite
on purpose.&nbsp; We have grand long talks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in our young lady that could still stay her from
asking for a personal description of these apparitions; that showed
too starved a state.&nbsp; But while she considered she took in afresh
the whole of the clergyman&rsquo;s widow.&nbsp; Mrs. Jordan couldn&rsquo;t
help her teeth, and her sleeves were a distinct rise in the world.&nbsp;
A thousand tulips at a shilling clearly took one further than a thousand
words at a penny; and the betrothed of Mr. Mudge, in whom the sense
of the race for life was always acute, found herself wondering, with
a twinge of her easy jealousy, if it mightn&rsquo;t after all then,
for <i>her</i> also, be better&mdash;better than where she was&mdash;to
follow some such scent.&nbsp; Where she was was where Mr. Buckton&rsquo;s
elbow could freely enter her right side and the counter-clerk&rsquo;s
breathing&mdash;he had something the matter with his nose&mdash;pervade
her left ear.&nbsp; It was something to fill an office under Government,
and she knew but too well there were places commoner still than Cocker&rsquo;s;
but it needed no great range of taste to bring home to her the picture
of servitude and promiscuity she couldn&rsquo;t but offer to the eye
of comparative freedom.&nbsp; She was so boxed up with her young men,
and anything like a margin so absent, that it needed more art than she
should ever possess to pretend in the least to compass, with any one
in the nature of an acquaintance&mdash;say with Mrs. Jordan herself,
flying in, as it might happen, to wire sympathetically to Mrs. Bubb&mdash;an
approach to a relation of elegant privacy.&nbsp; She remembered the
day when Mrs. Jordan <i>had</i>, in fact, by the greatest chance, come
in with fifty-three words for Lord Rye and a five-pound note to change.&nbsp;
This had been the dramatic manner of their reunion&mdash;their mutual
recognition was so great an event.&nbsp; The girl could at first only
see her from the waist up, besides making but little of her long telegram
to his lordship.&nbsp; It was a strange whirligig that had converted
the clergyman&rsquo;s widow into such a specimen of the class that went
beyond the sixpence.</p>
<p>Nothing of the occasion, all the more, had ever become dim; least
of all the way that, as her recovered friend looked up from counting,
Mrs. Jordan had just blown, in explanation, through her teeth and through
the bars of the cage: &ldquo;I <i>do</i> flowers, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Our young woman had always, with her little finger crooked out, a pretty
movement for counting; and she had not forgotten the small secret advantage,
a sharpness of triumph it might even have been called, that fell upon
her at this moment and avenged her for the incoherence of the message,
an unintelligible enumeration of numbers, colours, days, hours.&nbsp;
The correspondence of people she didn&rsquo;t know was one thing; but
the correspondence of people she did had an aspect of its own for her
even when she couldn&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp; The speech in which
Mrs. Jordan had defined a position and announced a profession was like
a tinkle of bluebells; but for herself her one idea about flowers was
that people had them at funerals, and her present sole gleam of light
was that lords probably had them most.&nbsp; When she watched, a minute
later, through the cage, the swing of her visitor&rsquo;s departing
petticoats, she saw the sight from the waist down; and when the counter-clerk,
after a mere male glance, remarked, with an intention unmistakeably
low, &ldquo;Handsome woman!&rdquo; she had for him the finest of her
chills: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the widow of a bishop.&rdquo;&nbsp; She always
felt, with the counter-clerk, that it was impossible sufficiently to
put it on; for what she wished to express to him was the maximum of
her contempt, and that element in her nature was confusedly stored.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A bishop&rdquo; was putting it on, but the counter-clerk&rsquo;s
approaches were vile.&nbsp; The night, after this, when, in the fulness
of time, Mrs. Jordan mentioned the grand long talks, the girl at last
brought out: &ldquo;Should <i>I</i> see them?&mdash;I mean if I <i>were</i>
to give up everything for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan at this became most arch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d send
you to all the bachelors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young lady could be reminded by such a remark that she usually
struck her friend as pretty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do <i>they</i> have their
flowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oceans.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;re the most particular.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Oh it was a wonderful world.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should see Lord Rye&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His flowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and his letters.&nbsp; He writes me pages on pages&mdash;with
the most adorable little drawings and plans.&nbsp; You should see his
diagrams!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>The girl had in course of time every opportunity to inspect these
documents, and they a little disappointed her; but in the mean while
there had been more talk, and it had led to her saying, as if her friend&rsquo;s
guarantee of a life of elegance were not quite definite: &ldquo;Well,
I see every one at <i>my</i> place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of swells.&nbsp; They flock.&nbsp; They live, you know,
all round, and the place is filled with all the smart people, all the
fast people, those whose names are in the papers&mdash;mamma has still
The Morning Post&mdash;and who come up for the season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan took this in with complete intelligence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
and I dare say it&rsquo;s some of your people that <i>I</i> do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her companion assented, but discriminated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I doubt if
you &lsquo;do&rsquo; them as much as I!&nbsp; Their affairs, their appointments
and arrangements, their little games and secrets and vices&mdash;those
things all pass before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a picture that could make a clergyman&rsquo;s widow not
imperceptibly gasp; it was in intention moreover something of a retort
to the thousand tulips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their vices?&nbsp; Have they got
vices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young critic even more overtly stared then with a touch of contempt
in her amusement: &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you found <i>that</i> out?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The homes of luxury then hadn&rsquo;t so much to give.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I</i>
find out everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan, at bottom a very meek person, was visibly struck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; You do &lsquo;have&rsquo; them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t care!&nbsp; Much good it does me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan after an instant recovered her superiority.&nbsp; &ldquo;No&mdash;it
doesn&rsquo;t lead to much.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her own initiations so clearly
did.&nbsp; Still&mdash;after all; and she was not jealous: &ldquo;There
must be a charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In seeing them?&rdquo;&nbsp; At this the girl suddenly let
herself go.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s that charm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan gaped again.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>real</i> &lsquo;smarts&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you call Mrs. Bubb?&nbsp; Yes&mdash;it comes
to me; I&rsquo;ve had Mrs. Bubb.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think she has been
in herself, but there are things her maid has brought.&nbsp; Well, my
dear!&rdquo;&mdash;and the young person from Cocker&rsquo;s, recalling
these things and summing them up, seemed suddenly to have much to say.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t say it, however; she checked it; she only brought out:
&ldquo;Her maid, who&rsquo;s horrid&mdash;<i>she</i> must have her!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then she went on with indifference: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re <i>too</i>
real!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re selfish brutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan, turning it over, adopted at last the plan of treating
it with a smile.&nbsp; She wished to be liberal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
of course, they do lay it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They bore me to death,&rdquo; her companion pursued with slightly
more temperance.</p>
<p>But this was going too far.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah that&rsquo;s because
you&rsquo;ve no sympathy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl gave an ironic laugh, only retorting that nobody could have
any who had to count all day all the words in the dictionary; a contention
Mrs. Jordan quite granted, the more that she shuddered at the notion
of ever failing of the very gift to which she owed the vogue&mdash;the
rage she might call it&mdash;that had caught her up.&nbsp; Without sympathy&mdash;or
without imagination, for it came back again to that&mdash;how should
she get, for big dinners, down the middle and toward the far corners
at all?&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t the combinations, which were easily managed:
the strain was over the ineffable simplicities, those that the bachelors
above all, and Lord Rye perhaps most of any, threw off&mdash;just blew
off like cigarette-puffs&mdash;such sketches of.&nbsp; The betrothed
of Mr. Mudge at all events accepted the explanation, which had the effect,
as almost any turn of their talk was now apt to have, of bringing her
round to the terrific question of that gentleman.&nbsp; She was tormented
with the desire to get out of Mrs. Jordan, on this subject, what she
was sure was at the back of Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s head; and to get it
out of her, queerly enough, if only to vent a certain irritation at
it.&nbsp; She knew that what her friend would already have risked if
she hadn&rsquo;t been timid and tortuous was: &ldquo;Give him up&mdash;yes,
give him up: you&rsquo;ll see that with your sure chances you&rsquo;ll
be able to do much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young woman had a sense that if that view could only be put before
her with a particular sniff for poor Mr. Mudge she should hate it as
much as she morally ought.&nbsp; She was conscious of not, as yet, hating
it quite so much as that.&nbsp; But she saw that Mrs. Jordan was conscious
of something too, and that there was a degree of confidence she was
waiting little by little to arrive at.&nbsp; The day came when the girl
caught a glimpse of what was still wanting to make her friend feel strong;
which was nothing less than the prospect of being able to announce the
climax of sundry private dreams.&nbsp; The associate of the aristocracy
had personal calculations&mdash;matter for brooding and dreaming, even
for peeping out not quite hopelessly from behind the window-curtains
of lonely lodgings.&nbsp; If she did the flowers for the bachelors,
in short, didn&rsquo;t she expect that to have consequences very different
from such an outlook at Cocker&rsquo;s as she had pronounced wholly
desperate?&nbsp; There seemed in very truth something auspicious in
the mixture of bachelors and flowers, though, when looked hard in the
eye, Mrs. Jordan was not quite prepared to say she had expected a positive
proposal from Lord Rye to pop out of it.&nbsp; Our young woman arrived
at last, none the less, at a definite vision of what was in her mind.&nbsp;
This was a vivid foreknowledge that the betrothed of Mr. Mudge would,
unless conciliated in advance by a successful rescue, almost hate her
on the day she should break a particular piece of news.&nbsp; How could
that unfortunate otherwise endure to hear of what, under the protection
of Lady Ventnor, was after all so possible.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, since irritation sometimes relieved her, the betrothed
of Mr. Mudge found herself indebted to that admirer for amounts of it
perfectly proportioned to her fidelity.&nbsp; She always walked with
him on Sundays, usually in the Regent&rsquo;s Park, and quite often,
once or twice a month he took her, in the Strand or thereabouts, to
see a piece that was having a run.&nbsp; The productions he always preferred
were the really good ones&mdash;Shakespeare, Thompson or some funny
American thing; which, as it also happened that she hated vulgar plays,
gave him ground for what was almost the fondest of his approaches, the
theory that their tastes were, blissfully, just the same.&nbsp; He was
for ever reminding her of that, rejoicing over it and being affectionate
and wise about it.&nbsp; There were times when she wondered how in the
world she could &ldquo;put up with&rdquo; him, how she could put up
with any man so smugly unconscious of the immensity of her difference.&nbsp;
It was just for this difference that, if she was to be liked at all,
she wanted to be liked, and if that was not the source of Mr. Mudge&rsquo;s
admiration, she asked herself what on earth <i>could</i> be?&nbsp; She
was not different only at one point, she was different all round; unless
perhaps indeed in being practically human, which her mind just barely
recognised that he also was.&nbsp; She would have made tremendous concessions
in other quarters: there was no limit for instance to those she would
have made to Captain Everard; but what I have named was the most she
was prepared to do for Mr. Mudge.&nbsp; It was because <i>he</i> was
different that, in the oddest way, she liked as well as deplored him;
which was after all a proof that the disparity, should they frankly
recognise it, wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be fatal.&nbsp; She felt that,
oleaginous&mdash;too oleaginous&mdash;as he was, he was somehow comparatively
primitive: she had once, during the portion of his time at Cocker&rsquo;s
that had overlapped her own, seen him collar a drunken soldier, a big
violent man who, having come in with a mate to get a postal-order cashed,
had made a grab at the money before his friend could reach it and had
so determined, among the hams and cheeses and the lodgers from Thrupp&rsquo;s,
immediate and alarming reprisals, a scene of scandal and consternation.&nbsp;
Mr. Buckton and the counter-clerk had crouched within the cage, but
Mr. Mudge had, with a very quiet but very quick step round the counter,
an air of masterful authority she shouldn&rsquo;t soon forget, triumphantly
interposed in the scrimmage, parted the combatants and shaken the delinquent
in his skin.&nbsp; She had been proud of him at that moment, and had
felt that if their affair had not already been settled the neatness
of his execution would have left her without resistance.</p>
<p>Their affair had been settled by other things: by the evident sincerity
of his passion and by the sense that his high white apron resembled
a front of many floors.&nbsp; It had gone a great way with her that
he would build up a business to his chin, which he carried quite in
the air.&nbsp; This could only be a question of time; he would have
all Piccadilly in the pen behind his ear.&nbsp; That was a merit in
itself for a girl who had known what she had known.&nbsp; There were
hours at which she even found him good-looking, though, frankly there
could be no crown for her effort to imagine on the part of the tailor
or the barber some such treatment of his appearance as would make him
resemble even remotely a man of the world.&nbsp; His very beauty was
the beauty of a grocer, and the finest future would offer it none too
much room consistently to develop.&nbsp; She had engaged herself in
short to the perfection of a type, and almost anything square and smooth
and whole had its weight for a person still conscious herself of being
a mere bruised fragment of wreckage.&nbsp; But it contributed hugely
at present to carry on the two parallel lines of her experience in the
cage and her experience out of it.&nbsp; After keeping quiet for some
time about this opposition she suddenly&mdash;one Sunday afternoon on
a penny chair in the Regent&rsquo;s Park&mdash;broke, for him, capriciously,
bewilderingly, into an intimation of what it came to.&nbsp; He had naturally
pressed more and more on the point of her again placing herself where
he could see her hourly, and for her to recognise that she had as yet
given him no sane reason for delay he had small need to describe himself
as unable to make out what she was up to.&nbsp; As if, with her absurd
bad reasons, she could have begun to tell him!&nbsp; Sometimes she thought
it would be amusing to let him have them full in the face, for she felt
she should die of him unless she once in a while stupefied him; and
sometimes she thought it would be disgusting and perhaps even fatal.&nbsp;
She liked him, however, to think her silly, for that gave her the margin
which at the best she would always require; and the only difficulty
about this was that he hadn&rsquo;t enough imagination to oblige her.&nbsp;
It produced none the less something of the desired effect&mdash;to leave
him simply wondering why, over the matter of their reunion, she didn&rsquo;t
yield to his arguments.&nbsp; Then at last, simply as if by accident
and out of mere boredom on a day that was rather flat, she preposterously
produced her own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, wait a bit.&nbsp; Where I am I
still see things.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she talked to him even worse, if
possible, than she had talked to Jordan.</p>
<p>Little by little, to her own stupefaction, she caught that he was
trying to take it as she meant it and that he was neither astonished
nor angry.&nbsp; Oh the British tradesman&mdash;this gave her an idea
of his resources!&nbsp; Mr. Mudge would be angry only with a person
who, like the drunken soldier in the shop, should have an unfavourable
effect on business.&nbsp; He seemed positively to enter, for the time
and without the faintest flash of irony or ripple of laughter, into
the whimsical grounds of her enjoyment of Cocker&rsquo;s custom, and
instantly to be casting up whatever it might, as Mrs. Jordan had said,
lead to.&nbsp; What he had in mind was not of course what Mrs. Jordan
had had: it was obviously not a source of speculation with him that
his sweetheart might pick up a husband.&nbsp; She could see perfectly
that this was not for a moment even what he supposed she herself dreamed
of.&nbsp; What she had done was simply to give his sensibility another
push into the dim vast of trade.&nbsp; In that direction it was all
alert, and she had whisked before it the mild fragrance of a &ldquo;connexion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That was the most he could see in any account of her keeping in, on
whatever roundabout lines, with the gentry; and when, getting to the
bottom of this, she quickly proceeded to show him the kind of eye she
turned on such people and to give him a sketch of what that eye discovered,
she reduced him to the particular prostration in which he could still
be amusing to her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the most awful wretches, I assure you&mdash;the
lot all about there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you want to stay among them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man, just because they <i>are</i>.&nbsp; It makes
me hate them so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate them?&nbsp; I thought you liked them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid.&nbsp; What I &lsquo;like&rsquo; is
just to loathe them.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t believe what passes before
my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why have you never told me?&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t mention
anything before I left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I hadn&rsquo;t got round to it then.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
sort of thing you don&rsquo;t believe at first; you have to look round
you a bit and then you understand.&nbsp; You work into it more and more.&nbsp;
Besides,&rdquo; the girl went on, &ldquo;this is the time of the year
when the worst lot come up.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re simply packed together
in those smart streets.&nbsp; Talk of the numbers of the poor!&nbsp;
What <i>I</i> can vouch for is the numbers of the rich!&nbsp; There
are new ones every day, and they seem to get richer and richer.&nbsp;
Oh, they do come up!&rdquo; she cried, imitating for her private recreation&mdash;she
was sure it wouldn&rsquo;t reach Mr. Mudge&mdash;the low intonation
of the counter-clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where do they come from?&rdquo; her companion candidly
enquired.</p>
<p>She had to think a moment; then she found something.&nbsp; &ldquo;From
the &lsquo;spring meetings.&rsquo;&nbsp; They bet tremendously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they bet enough at Chalk Farm, if that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> all.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t a millionth
part!&rdquo; she replied with some sharpness.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
immense fun&rdquo;&mdash;she <i>had</i> to tantalise him.&nbsp; Then
as she had heard Mrs. Jordan say, and as the ladies at Cocker&rsquo;s
even sometimes wired, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite too dreadful!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She could fully feel how it was Mr. Mudge&rsquo;s propriety, which was
extreme&mdash;he had a horror of coarseness and attended a Wesleyan
chapel&mdash;that prevented his asking for details.&nbsp; But she gave
him some of the more innocuous in spite of himself, especially putting
before him how, at Simpkin&rsquo;s and Ladle&rsquo;s, they all made
the money fly.&nbsp; That was indeed what he liked to hear: the connexion
was not direct, but one was somehow more in the right place where the
money was flying than where it was simply and meagrely nesting.&nbsp;
The air felt that stir, he had to acknowledge, much less at Chalk Farm
than in the district in which his beloved so oddly enjoyed her footing.&nbsp;
She gave him, she could see, a restless sense that these might be familiarities
not to be sacrificed; germs, possibilities, faint foreshowings&mdash;heaven
knew what&mdash;of the initiation it would prove profitable to have
arrived at when in the fulness of time he should have his own shop in
some such paradise.&nbsp; What really touched him&mdash;that was discernible&mdash;was
that she could feed him with so much mere vividness of reminder, keep
before him, as by the play of a fan, the very wind of the swift bank-notes
and the charm of the existence of a class that Providence had raised
up to be the blessing of grocers.&nbsp; He liked to think that the class
was there, that it was always there, and that she contributed in her
slight but appreciable degree to keep it up to the mark.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
have formulated his theory of the matter, but the exuberance of the
aristocracy was the advantage of trade, and everything was knit together
in a richness of pattern that it was good to follow with one&rsquo;s
finger-tips.&nbsp; It was a comfort to him to be thus assured that there
were no symptoms of a drop.&nbsp; What did the sounder, as she called
it, nimbly worked, do but keep the ball going?</p>
<p>What it came to therefore for Mr. Mudge was that all enjoyments were,
as might be said, inter-related, and that the more people had the more
they wanted to have.&nbsp; The more flirtations, as he might roughly
express it, the more cheese and pickles.&nbsp; He had even in his own
small way been dimly struck with the link&egrave;d sweetness connecting
the tender passion with cheap champagne, or perhaps the other way round.&nbsp;
What he would have liked to say had he been able to work out his thought
to the end was: &ldquo;I see, I see.&nbsp; Lash them up then, lead them
on, keep them going: some of it can&rsquo;t help, some time, coming
<i>our</i> way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet he was troubled by the suspicion of
subtleties on his companion&rsquo;s part that spoiled the straight view.&nbsp;
He couldn&rsquo;t understand people&rsquo;s hating what they liked or
liking what they hated; above all it hurt him somewhere&mdash;for he
had his private delicacies&mdash;to see anything <i>but</i> money made
out of his betters.&nbsp; To be too enquiring, or in any other way too
free, at the expense of the gentry was vaguely wrong; the only thing
that was distinctly right was to be prosperous at any price.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t
it just because they were up there aloft that they were lucrative?&nbsp;
He concluded at any rate by saying to his young friend: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s
improper for you to remain at Cocker&rsquo;s, then that falls in exactly
with the other reasons I&rsquo;ve put before you for your removal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Improper?&rdquo;&mdash;her smile became a prolonged boldness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear boy, there&rsquo;s no one like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; he laughed; &ldquo;but that doesn&rsquo;t
help the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give up my
friends.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m making even more than Mrs. Jordan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mudge considered.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much is <i>she</i> making?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you dear donkey!&rdquo;&mdash;and, regardless of all the
Regent&rsquo;s Park, she patted his cheek.&nbsp; This was the sort of
moment at which she was absolutely tempted to tell him that she liked
to be near Park Chambers.&nbsp; There was a fascination in the idea
of seeing if, on a mention of Captain Everard, he wouldn&rsquo;t do
what she thought he might; wouldn&rsquo;t weigh against the obvious
objection the still more obvious advantage.&nbsp; The advantage of course
could only strike him at the best as rather fantastic; but it was always
to the good to keep hold when you <i>had</i> hold, and such an attitude
would also after all involve a high tribute to her fidelity.&nbsp; Of
one thing she absolutely never doubted: Mr. Mudge believed in her with
a belief&mdash;!&nbsp; She believed in herself too, for that matter:
if there was a thing in the world no one could charge her with it was
being the kind of low barmaid person who rinsed tumblers and bandied
slang.&nbsp; But she forbore as yet to speak; she had not spoken even
to Mrs. Jordan; and the hush that on her lips surrounded the Captain&rsquo;s
name maintained itself as a kind of symbol of the success that, up to
this time, had attended something or other&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t
have said what&mdash;that she humoured herself with calling, without
words, her relation with him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>She would have admitted indeed that it consisted of little more than
the fact that his absences, however frequent and however long, always
ended with his turning up again.&nbsp; It was nobody&rsquo;s business
in the world but her own if that fact continued to be enough for her.&nbsp;
It was of course not enough just in itself; what it had taken on to
make it so was the extraordinary possession of the elements of his life
that memory and attention had at last given her.&nbsp; There came a
day when this possession on the girl&rsquo;s part actually seemed to
enjoy between them, while their eyes met, a tacit recognition that was
half a joke and half a deep solemnity.&nbsp; He bade her good morning
always now; he often quite raised his hat to her.&nbsp; He passed a
remark when there was time or room, and once she went so far as to say
to him that she hadn&rsquo;t seen him for &ldquo;ages.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ages&rdquo; was the word she consciously and carefully, though
a trifle tremulously used; &ldquo;ages&rdquo; was exactly what she meant.&nbsp;
To this he replied in terms doubtless less anxiously selected, but perhaps
on that account not the less remarkable, &ldquo;Oh yes, hasn&rsquo;t
it been awfully wet?&rdquo;&nbsp; That was a specimen of their give
and take; it fed her fancy that no form of intercourse so transcendent
and distilled had ever been established on earth.&nbsp; Everything,
so far as they chose to consider it so, might mean almost anything.&nbsp;
The want of margin in the cage, when he peeped through the bars, wholly
ceased to be appreciable.&nbsp; It was a drawback only in superficial
commerce.&nbsp; With Captain Everard she had simply the margin of the
universe.&nbsp; It may be imagined therefore how their unuttered reference
to all she knew about him could in this immensity play at its ease.&nbsp;
Every time he handed in a telegram it was an addition to her knowledge:
what did his constant smile mean to mark if it didn&rsquo;t mean to
mark that?&nbsp; He never came into the place without saying to her
in this manner: &ldquo;Oh yes, you have me by this time so completely
at your mercy that it doesn&rsquo;t in the least matter what I give
you now.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve become a comfort, I assure you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had only two torments; the greatest of which was that she couldn&rsquo;t,
not even once or twice, touch with him on some individual fact.&nbsp;
She would have given anything to have been able to allude to one of
his friends by name, to one of his engagements by date, to one of his
difficulties by the solution.&nbsp; She would have given almost as much
for just the right chance&mdash;it would have to be tremendously right&mdash;to
show him in some sharp sweet way that she had perfectly penetrated the
greatest of these last and now lived with it in a kind of heroism of
sympathy.&nbsp; He was in love with a woman to whom, and to any view
of whom, a lady-telegraphist, and especially one who passed a life among
hams and cheeses, was as the sand on the floor; and what her dreams
desired was the possibility of its somehow coming to him that her own
interest in him could take a pure and noble account of such an infatuation
and even of such an impropriety.&nbsp; As yet, however, she could only
rub along with the hope that an accident, sooner or later, might give
her a lift toward popping out with something that would surprise and
perhaps even, some fine day, assist him.&nbsp; What could people mean
moreover&mdash;cheaply sarcastic people&mdash;by not feeling all that
could be got out of the weather?&nbsp; <i>She</i> felt it all, and seemed
literally to feel it most when she went quite wrong, speaking of the
stuffy days as cold, of the cold ones as stuffy, and betraying how little
she knew, in her cage, of whether it was foul or fair.&nbsp; It was
for that matter always stuffy at Cocker&rsquo;s, and she finally settled
down to the safe proposition that the outside element was &ldquo;changeable.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Anything seemed true that made him so radiantly assent.</p>
<p>This indeed is a small specimen of her cultivation of insidious ways
of making things easy for him&mdash;ways to which of course she couldn&rsquo;t
be at all sure he did real justice.&nbsp; Real justice was not of this
world: she had had too often to come back to that; yet, strangely, happiness
was, and her traps had to be set for it in a manner to keep them unperceived
by Mr. Buckton and the counter-clerk.&nbsp; The most she could hope
for apart from the question, which constantly flickered up and died
down, of the divine chance of his consciously liking her, would be that,
without analysing it, he should arrive at a vague sense that Cocker&rsquo;s
was&mdash;well, attractive; easier, smoother, sociably brighter, slightly
more picturesque, in short more propitious in general to his little
affairs, than any other establishment just thereabouts.&nbsp; She was
quite aware that they couldn&rsquo;t be, in so huddled a hole, particularly
quick; but she found her account in the slowness&mdash;she certainly
could bear it if <i>he</i> could.&nbsp; The great pang was that just
thereabouts post-offices were so awfully thick.&nbsp; She was always
seeing him in imagination in other places and with other girls.&nbsp;
But she would defy any other girl to follow him as she followed.&nbsp;
And though they weren&rsquo;t, for so many reasons, quick at Cocker&rsquo;s,
she could hurry for him when, through an intimation light as air, she
gathered that he was pressed.</p>
<p>When hurry was, better still, impossible, it was because of the pleasantest
thing of all, the particular element of their contact&mdash;she would
have called it their friendship&mdash;that consisted of an almost humorous
treatment of the look of some of his words.&nbsp; They would never perhaps
have grown half so intimate if he had not, by the blessing of heaven,
formed some of his letters with a queerness&mdash;!&nbsp; It was positive
that the queerness could scarce have been greater if he had practised
it for the very purpose of bringing their heads together over it as
far as was possible to heads on different sides of a wire fence.&nbsp;
It had taken her truly but once or twice to master these tricks, but,
at the cost of striking him perhaps as stupid, she could still challenge
them when circumstances favoured.&nbsp; The great circumstance that
favoured was that she sometimes actually believed he knew she only feigned
perplexity.&nbsp; If he knew it therefore he tolerated it; if he tolerated
it he came back; and if he came back he liked her.&nbsp; This was her
seventh heaven; and she didn&rsquo;t ask much of his liking&mdash;she
only asked of it to reach the point of his not going away because of
her own.&nbsp; He had at times to be away for weeks; he had to lead
lets life; he had to travel&mdash;there were places to which he was
constantly wiring for &ldquo;rooms&rdquo;: all this she granted him,
forgave him; in fact, in the long run, literally blessed and thanked
him for.&nbsp; If he had to lead his life, that precisely fostered his
leading it so much by telegraph: therefore the benediction was to come
in when he could.&nbsp; That was all she asked&mdash;that he shouldn&rsquo;t
wholly deprive her.</p>
<p>Sometimes she almost felt that he couldn&rsquo;t have deprived her
even had he been minded, by reason of the web of revelation that was
woven between them.&nbsp; She quite thrilled herself with thinking what,
with such a lot of material, a bad girl would do.&nbsp; It would be
a scene better than many in her ha&rsquo;penny novels, this going to
him in the dusk of evening at Park Chambers and letting him at last
have it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know too much about a certain person now not
to put it to you&mdash;excuse my being so lurid&mdash;that it&rsquo;s
quite worth your while to buy me off.&nbsp; Come, therefore; buy me!&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was a point indeed at which such flights had to drop again&mdash;the
point of an unreadiness to name, when it came to that, the purchasing
medium.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t certainly be anything so gross as money,
and the matter accordingly remained rather vague, all the more that
<i>she</i> was not a bad girl.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t for any such reason
as might have aggravated a mere minx that she often hoped he would again
bring Cissy.&nbsp; The difficulty of this, however, was constantly present
to her, for the kind of communion to which Cocker&rsquo;s so richly
ministered rested on the fact that Cissy and he were so often in different
places.&nbsp; She knew by this time all the places&mdash;Suchbury, Monkhouse,
Whiteroy, Finches&mdash;and even how the parties on these occasions
were composed; but her subtlety found ways to make her knowledge fairly
protect and promote their keeping, as she had heard Mrs. Jordan say,
in touch.&nbsp; So, when he actually sometimes smiled as if he really
felt the awkwardness of giving her again one of the same old addresses,
all her being went out in the desire&mdash;which her face must have
expressed&mdash;that he should recognise her forbearance to criticise
as one of the finest tenderest sacrifices a woman had ever made for
love.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>She was occasionally worried, however this might be, by the impression
that these sacrifices, great as they were, were nothing to those that
his own passion had imposed; if indeed it was not rather the passion
of his confederate, which had caught him up and was whirling him round
like a great steam-wheel.&nbsp; He was at any rate in the strong grip
of a dizzy splendid fate; the wild wind of his life blew him straight
before it.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she catch in his face at times, even through
his smile and his happy habit, the gleam of that pale glare with which
a bewildered victim appeals, as he passes, to some pair of pitying eyes?&nbsp;
He perhaps didn&rsquo;t even himself know how scared he was; but <i>she</i>
knew.&nbsp; They were in danger, they were in danger, Captain Everard
and Lady Bradeen: it beat every novel in the shop.&nbsp; She thought
of Mr. Mudge and his safe sentiment; she thought of herself and blushed
even more for her tepid response to it.&nbsp; It was a comfort to her
at such moments to feel that in another relation&mdash;a relation supplying
that affinity with her nature that Mr. Mudge, deluded creature, would
never supply&mdash;she should have been no more tepid than her ladyship.&nbsp;
Her deepest soundings were on two or three occasions of finding herself
almost sure that, if she dared, her ladyship&rsquo;s lover would have
gathered relief from &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; to her.&nbsp; She literally
fancied once or twice that, projected as he was toward his doom, her
own eyes struck him, while the air roared in his ears, as the one pitying
pair in the crowd.&nbsp; But how could he speak to her while she sat
sandwiched there between the counter-clerk and the sounder?</p>
<p>She had long ago, in her comings and goings made acquaintance with
Park Chambers and reflected as she looked up at their luxurious front
that they of course would supply the ideal setting for the ideal speech.&nbsp;
There was not an object in London that, before the season was over,
was more stamped upon her brain.&nbsp; She went roundabout to pass it,
for it was not on the short way; she passed on the opposite side of
the street and always looked up, though it had taken her a long time
to be sure of the particular set of windows.&nbsp; She had made that
out finally by an act of audacity that at the time had almost stopped
her heart-beats and that in retrospect greatly quickened her blushes.&nbsp;
One evening she had lingered late and watched&mdash;watched for some
moment when the porter, who was in uniform and often on the steps, had
gone in with a visitor.&nbsp; Then she followed boldly, on the calculation
that he would have taken the visitor up and that the hall would be free.&nbsp;
The hall <i>was</i> free, and the electric light played over the gilded
and lettered board that showed the names and numbers of the occupants
of the different floors.&nbsp; What she wanted looked straight at her&mdash;Captain
Everard was on the third.&nbsp; It was as if, in the immense intimacy
of this, they were, for the instant and the first time, face to face
outside the cage.&nbsp; Alas! they were face to face but a second or
two: she was whirled out on the wings of a panic fear that he might
just then be entering or issuing.&nbsp; This fear was indeed, in her
shameless deflexions, never very far from her, and was mixed in the
oddest way with depressions and disappointments.&nbsp; It was dreadful,
as she trembled by, to run the risk of looking to him as if she basely
hung about; and yet it was dreadful to be obliged to pass only at such
moments as put an encounter out of the question.</p>
<p>At the horrible hour of her first coming to Cocker&rsquo;s he was
always&mdash;it was to be hoped&mdash;snug in bed; and at the hour of
her final departure he was of course&mdash;she had such things all on
her fingers&rsquo;-ends&mdash;dressing for dinner.&nbsp; We may let
it pass that if she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to hover till he was
dressed, this was simply because such a process for such a person could
only be terribly prolonged.&nbsp; When she went in the middle of the
day to her own dinner she had too little time to do anything but go
straight, though it must be added that for a real certainty she would
joyously have omitted the repast.&nbsp; She had made up her mind as
to there being on the whole no decent pretext to justify her flitting
casually past at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; That was
the hour at which, if the ha&rsquo;penny novels were not all wrong,
he probably came home for the night.&nbsp; She was therefore reduced
to the vainest figuration of the miraculous meeting toward which a hundred
impossibilities would have to conspire.&nbsp; But if nothing was more
impossible than the fact, nothing was more intense than the vision.&nbsp;
What may not, we can only moralise, take place in the quickened muffled
perception of a young person with an ardent soul?&nbsp; All our humble
friend&rsquo;s native distinction, her refinement of personal grain,
of heredity, of pride, took refuge in this small throbbing spot; for
when she was most conscious of the objection of her vanity and the pitifulness
of her little flutters and manoeuvres, then the consolation and the
redemption were most sure to glow before her in some just discernible
sign.&nbsp; He did like her!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>He never brought Cissy back, but Cissy came one day without him,
as fresh as before from the hands of Marguerite, or only, at the season&rsquo;s
end, a trifle less fresh.&nbsp; She was, however, distinctly less serene.&nbsp;
She had brought nothing with her and looked about with impatience for
the forms and the place to write.&nbsp; The latter convenience, at Cocker&rsquo;s,
was obscure and barely adequate, and her clear voice had the light note
of disgust which her lover&rsquo;s never showed as she responded with
a &ldquo;There?&rdquo; of surprise to the gesture made by the counter-clerk
in answer to her sharp question.&nbsp; Our young friend was busy with
half a dozen people, but she had dispatched them in her most businesslike
manner by the time her ladyship flung through the bars this light of
re-appearance.&nbsp; Then the directness with which the girl managed
to receive the accompanying missive was the result of the concentration
that had caused her to make the stamps fly during the few minutes occupied
by the production of it.&nbsp; This concentration, in turn, may be described
as the effect of the apprehension of imminent relief.&nbsp; It was nineteen
days, counted and checked off, since she had seen the object of her
homage; and as, had he been in London, she should, with his habits,
have been sure to see him often, she was now about to learn what other
spot his presence might just then happen to sanctify.&nbsp; For she
thought of them, the other spots, as ecstatically conscious of it, expressively
happy in it.</p>
<p>But, gracious, how handsome was her ladyship, and what an added price
it gave him that the air of intimacy he threw out should have flowed
originally from such a source!&nbsp; The girl looked straight through
the cage at the eyes and lips that must so often have been so near as
own&mdash;looked at them with a strange passion that for an instant
had the result of filling out some of the gaps, supplying the missing
answers, in his correspondence.&nbsp; Then as she made out that the
features she thus scanned and associated were totally unaware of it,
that they glowed only with the colour of quite other and not at all
guessable thoughts, this directly added to their splendour, gave the
girl the sharpest impression she had yet received of the uplifted, the
unattainable plains of heaven, and yet at the same time caused her to
thrill with a sense of the high company she did somehow keep.&nbsp;
She was with the absent through her ladyship and with her ladyship through
the absent.&nbsp; The only pang&mdash;but it didn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;was
the proof in the admirable face, in the sightless preoccupation of its
possessor, that the latter hadn&rsquo;t a notion of her.&nbsp; Her folly
had gone to the point of half believing that the other party to the
affair must sometimes mention in Eaton Square the extraordinary little
person at the place from which he so often wired.&nbsp; Yet the perception
of her visitor&rsquo;s blankness actually helped this extraordinary
little person, the next instant, to take refuge in a reflexion that
could be as proud as it liked.&nbsp; &ldquo;How little she knows, how
little she knows!&rdquo; the girl cried to herself; for what did that
show after all but that Captain Everard&rsquo;s telegraphic confidant
was Captain Everard&rsquo;s charming secret?&nbsp; Our young friend&rsquo;s
perusal of her ladyship&rsquo;s telegram was literally prolonged by
a momentary daze: what swam between her and the words, making her see
them as through rippled shallow sunshot water, was the great, the perpetual
flood of &ldquo;How much <i>I</i> know&mdash;how much <i>I</i> know!&rdquo;&nbsp;
This produced a delay in her catching that, on the face, these words
didn&rsquo;t give her what she wanted, though she was prompt enough
with her remembrance that her grasp was, half the time, just of what
was <i>not</i> on the face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Dolman, Parade Lodge,
Parade Terrace, Dover.&nbsp; Let him instantly know right one, H&ocirc;tel
de France, Ostend.&nbsp; Make it seven nine four nine six one.&nbsp;
Wire me alternative Burfield&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl slowly counted.&nbsp; Then he was at Ostend.&nbsp; This
hooked on with so sharp a click that, not to feel she was as quickly
letting it all slip from her, she had absolutely to hold it a minute
longer and to do something to that end.&nbsp; Thus it was that she did
on this occasion what she never did&mdash;threw off a &ldquo;Reply paid?&rdquo;
that sounded officious, but that she partly made up for by deliberately
affixing the stamps and by waiting till she had done so to give change.&nbsp;
She had, for so much coolness, the strength that she considered she
knew all about Miss Dolman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;paid.&rdquo;&nbsp; She saw all sorts of things in
this reply, even to a small suppressed start of surprise at so correct
an assumption; even to an attempt the next minute at a fresh air of
detachment.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much, with the answer?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
calculation was not abstruse, but our intense observer required a moment
more to make it, and this gave her ladyship time for a second thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh just wait!&rdquo;&nbsp; The white begemmed hand bared to write
rose in sudden nervousness to the side of the wonderful face which,
with eyes of anxiety for the paper on the counter, she brought closer
to the bars of the cage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I must alter a word!&rdquo;&nbsp;
On this she recovered her telegram and looked over it again; but she
had a new, an obvious trouble, and studied it without deciding and with
much of the effect of making our young woman watch her.</p>
<p>This personage, meanwhile, at the sight of her expression, had decided
on the spot.&nbsp; If she had always been sure they were in danger her
ladyship&rsquo;s expression was the best possible sign of it.&nbsp;
There was a word wrong, but she had lost the right one, and much clearly
depended on her finding it again.&nbsp; The girl, therefore, sufficiently
estimating the affluence of customers and the distraction of Mr. Buckton
and the counter-clerk, took the jump and gave it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
it Cooper&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was as if she had bodily leaped&mdash;cleared the top of the cage
and alighted on her interlocutress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cooper&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&mdash;the
stare was heightened by a blush.&nbsp; Yes, she had made Juno blush.</p>
<p>This was all the greater reason for going on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean
instead of Burfield&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young friend fairly pitied her; she had made her in an instant
so helpless, and yet not a bit haughty nor outraged.&nbsp; She was only
mystified and scared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you know&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know!&rdquo;&nbsp; Our young friend smiled, meeting
the other&rsquo;s eyes, and, having made Juno blush, proceeded to patronise
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> do it&rdquo;&mdash;she put out a
competent hand.&nbsp; Her ladyship only submitted, confused and bewildered,
all presence of mind quite gone; and the next moment the telegram was
in the cage again and its author out of the shop.&nbsp; Then quickly,
boldly, under all the eyes that might have witnessed her tampering,
the extraordinary little person at Cocker&rsquo;s made the proper change.&nbsp;
People were really too giddy, and if they <i>were</i>, in a certain
case, to be caught, it shouldn&rsquo;t be the fault of her own grand
memory.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t it been settled weeks before?&mdash;for Miss
Dolman it was always to be &ldquo;Cooper&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>But the summer &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; brought a marked difference;
they were holidays for almost every one but the animals in the cage.&nbsp;
The August days were flat and dry, and, with so little to feed it, she
was conscious of the ebb of her interest in the secrets of the refined.&nbsp;
She was in a position to follow the refined to the extent of knowing&mdash;they
had made so many of their arrangements with her aid&mdash;exactly where
they were; yet she felt quite as if the panorama had ceased unrolling
and the band stopped playing.&nbsp; A stray member of the latter occasionally
turned up, but the communications that passed before her bore now largely
on rooms at hotels, prices of furnished houses, hours of trains, dates
of sailings and arrangements for being &ldquo;met&rdquo;; she found
them for the most part prosaic and coarse.&nbsp; The only thing was
that they brought into her stuffy corner as straight a whiff of Alpine
meadows and Scotch moors as she might hope ever to inhale; there were
moreover in especial fat hot dull ladies who had out with her, to exasperation,
the terms for seaside lodgings, which struck her as huge, and the matter
of the number of beds required, which was not less portentous: this
in reference to places of which the names&mdash;Eastbourne, Folkestone,
Cromer, Scarborough, Whitby&mdash;tormented her with something of the
sound of the plash of water that haunts the traveller in the desert.&nbsp;
She had not been out of London for a dozen years, and the only thing
to give a taste to the present dead weeks was the spice of a chronic
resentment.&nbsp; The sparse customers, the people she did see, were
the people who were &ldquo;just off&rdquo;&mdash;off on the decks of
fluttered yachts, off to the uttermost point of rocky headlands where
the very breeze was then playing for the want of which she said to herself
that she sickened.</p>
<p>There was accordingly a sense in which, at such a period, the great
differences of the human condition could press upon her more than ever;
a circumstance drawing fresh force in truth from the very fact of the
chance that at last, for a change, did squarely meet her&mdash;the chance
to be &ldquo;off,&rdquo; for a bit, almost as far as anybody.&nbsp;
They took their turns in the cage as they took them both in the shop
and at Chalk Farm; she had known these two months that time was to be
allowed in September&mdash;no less than eleven days&mdash;for her personal
private holiday.&nbsp; Much of her recent intercourse with Mr. Mudge
had consisted of the hopes and fears, expressed mainly by himself, involved
in the question of their getting the same dates&mdash;a question that,
in proportion as the delight seemed assured, spread into a sea of speculation
over the choice of where and how.&nbsp; All through July, on the Sunday
evenings and at such other odd times as he could seize, he had flooded
their talk with wild waves of calculation.&nbsp; It was practically
settled that, with her mother, somewhere &ldquo;on the south coast&rdquo;
(a phrase of which she liked the sound) they should put in their allowance
together; but she already felt the prospect quite weary and worn with
the way he went round and round on it.&nbsp; It had become his sole
topic, the theme alike of his most solemn prudences and most placid
jests, to which every opening led for return and revision and in which
every little flower of a foretaste was pulled up as soon as planted.&nbsp;
He had announced at the earliest day&mdash;characterising the whole
business, from that moment, as their &ldquo;plans,&rdquo; under which
name he handled it as a Syndicate handles a Chinese or other Loan&mdash;he
had promptly declared that the question must be thoroughly studied,
and he produced, on the whole subject, from day to day, an amount of
information that excited her wonder and even, not a little, as she frankly
let him know, her disdain.&nbsp; When she thought of the danger in which
another pair of lovers rapturously lived she enquired of him anew why
he could leave nothing to chance.&nbsp; Then she got for answer that
this profundity was just his pride, and he pitted Ramsgate against Bournemouth
and even Boulogne against Jersey&mdash;for he had great ideas&mdash;with
all the mastery of detail that was some day, professionally, to carry
him afar.</p>
<p>The longer the time since she had seen Captain Everard the more she
was booked, as she called it, to pass Park Chambers; and this was the
sole amusement that in the lingering August days and the twilights sadly
drawn out it was left her to cultivate.&nbsp; She had long since learned
to know it for a feeble one, though its feebleness was perhaps scarce
the reason for her saying to herself each evening as her time for departure
approached: &ldquo;No, no&mdash;not to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; She never
failed of that silent remark, any more than she failed of feeling, in
some deeper place than she had even yet fully sounded, that one&rsquo;s
remarks were as weak as straws and that, however one might indulge in
them at eight o&rsquo;clock, one&rsquo;s fate infallibly declared itself
in absolute indifference to them at about eight-fifteen.&nbsp; Remarks
were remarks, and very well for that; but fate was fate, and this young
lady&rsquo;s was to pass Park Chambers every night in the working week.&nbsp;
Out of the immensity of her knowledge of the life of the world there
bloomed on these occasions as specific remembrance that it was regarded
in that region, in August and September, as rather pleasant just to
be caught for something or other in passing through town.&nbsp; Somebody
was always passing and somebody might catch somebody else.&nbsp; It
was in full cognisance of this subtle law that she adhered to the most
ridiculous circuit she could have made to get home.&nbsp; One warm dull
featureless Friday, when an accident had made her start from Cocker&rsquo;s
a little later than usual, she became aware that something of which
the infinite possibilities had for so long peopled her dreams was at
last prodigiously upon her, though the perfection in which the conditions
happened to present it was almost rich enough to be but the positive
creation of a dream.&nbsp; She saw, straight before her, like a vista
painted in a picture, the empty street and the lamps that burned pale
in the dusk not yet established.&nbsp; It was into the convenience of
this quiet twilight that a gentleman on the doorstep of the Chambers
gazed with a vagueness that our young lady&rsquo;s little figure violently
trembled, in the approach, with the measure of its power to dissipate.&nbsp;
Everything indeed grew in a flash terrific and distinct; her old uncertainties
fell away from her, and, since she was so familiar with fate, she felt
as if the very nail that fixed it were driven in by the hard look with
which, for a moment, Captain Everard awaited her.</p>
<p>The vestibule was open behind him and the porter as absent as on
the day she had peeped in; he had just come out&mdash;was in town, in
a tweed suit and a pot hat, but between two journeys&mdash;duly bored
over his evening and at a loss what to do with it.&nbsp; Then it was
that she was glad she had never met him in that way before: she reaped
with such ecstasy the benefit of his not being able to think she passed
often.&nbsp; She jumped in two seconds to the determination that he
should even suppose it to be the very first time and the very oddest
chance: this was while she still wondered if he would identify or notice
her.&nbsp; His original attention had not, she instinctively knew, been
for the young woman at Cocker&rsquo;s; it had only been for any young
woman who might advance to the tune of her not troubling the quiet air,
and in fact the poetic hour, with ugliness.&nbsp; Ah but then, and just
as she had reached the door, came his second observation, a long light
reach with which, visibly and quite amusedly, he recalled and placed
her.&nbsp; They were on different sides, but the street, narrow and
still, had only made more of a stage for the small momentary drama.&nbsp;
It was not over, besides, it was far from over, even on his sending
across the way, with the pleasantest laugh she had ever heard, a little
lift of his hat and an &ldquo;Oh good evening!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was still
less over on their meeting, the next minute, though rather indirectly
and awkwardly, in the middle, of the road&mdash;a situation to which
three or four steps of her own had unmistakeably contributed&mdash;and
then passing not again to the side on which she had arrived, but back
toward the portal of Park Chambers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you at first.&nbsp; Are you taking a walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I don&rsquo;t take walks at night!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going
home after my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was practically what they had meanwhile smiled out, and his
exclamation to which for a minute he appeared to have nothing to add,
left them face to face and in just such an attitude as, for his part,
he might have worn had he been wondering if he could properly ask her
to come in.&nbsp; During this interval in fact she really felt his question
to be just &ldquo;<i>How</i> properly&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was simply
a question of the degree of properness.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>She never knew afterwards quite what she had done to settle it, and
at the time she only knew that they presently moved, with vagueness,
yet with continuity, away from the picture of the lighted vestibule
and the quiet stairs and well up the street together.&nbsp; This also
must have been in the absence of a definite permission, of anything
vulgarly articulate, for that matter, on the part of either; and it
was to be, later on, a thing of remembrance and reflexion for her that
the limit of what just here for a longish minute passed between them
was his taking in her thoroughly successful deprecation, though conveyed
without pride or sound or touch, of the idea that she might be, out
of the cage, the very shop-girl at large that she hugged the theory
she wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Yes, it was strange, she afterwards thought,
that so much could have come and gone and yet not disfigured the dear
little intense crisis either with impertinence or with resentment, with
any of the horrid notes of that kind of acquaintance.&nbsp; He had taken
no liberty, as she would have so called it; and, through not having
to betray the sense of one, she herself had, still more charmingly,
taken none.&nbsp; On the spot, nevertheless, she could speculate as
to what it meant that, if his relation with Lady Bradeen continued to
be what her mind had built it up to, he should feel free to proceed
with marked independence.&nbsp; This was one of the questions he was
to leave her to deal with&mdash;the question whether people of his sort
still asked girls up to their rooms when they were so awfully in love
with other women.&nbsp; Could people of his sort do that without what
people of her sort would call being &ldquo;false to their love&rdquo;?&nbsp;
She had already a vision of how the true answer was that people of her
sort didn&rsquo;t, in such cases, matter&mdash;didn&rsquo;t count as
infidelity, counted only as something else: she might have been curious,
since it came to that, to see exactly what.</p>
<p>Strolling together slowly in their summer twilight and their empty
corner of Mayfair, they found themselves emerge at last opposite to
one of the smaller gates of the Park; upon which, without any particular
word about it&mdash;they were talking so of other things&mdash;they
crossed the street and went in and sat down on a bench.&nbsp; She had
gathered by this time one magnificent hope about him&mdash;the hope
he would say nothing vulgar.&nbsp; She knew thoroughly what she meant
by that; she meant something quite apart from any matter of his being
&ldquo;false.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their bench was not far within; it was near
the Park Lane paling and the patchy lamplight and the rumbling cabs
and &lsquo;buses.&nbsp; A strange emotion had come to her, and she felt
indeed excitement within excitement; above all a conscious joy in testing
him with chances he didn&rsquo;t take.&nbsp; She had an intense desire
he should know the type she really conformed to without her doing anything
so low as tell him, and he had surely begun to know it from the moment
he didn&rsquo;t seize the opportunities into which a common man would
promptly have blundered.&nbsp; These were on the mere awkward surface,
and <i>their</i> relation was beautiful behind and below them.&nbsp;
She had questioned so little on the way what they might be doing that
as soon as they were seated she took straight hold of it.&nbsp; Her
hours, her confinement, the many conditions of service in the post-office,
had&mdash;with a glance at his own postal resources and alternatives&mdash;formed,
up to this stage, the subject of their talk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, here
we are, and it may be right enough; but this isn&rsquo;t the least,
you know, where I was going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were going home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I was already rather late.&nbsp; I was going to my
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t eaten&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked of a sudden so extravagantly concerned that she laughed
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;All day?&nbsp; Yes, we do feed once.&nbsp; But that
was long ago.&nbsp; So I must presently say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh deary <i>me</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed with an intonation
so droll and yet a touch so light and a distress so marked&mdash;a confession
of helplessness for such a case, in short, so unrelieved&mdash;that
she at once felt sure she had made the great difference plain.&nbsp;
He looked at her with the kindest eyes and still without saying what
she had known he wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She had known he wouldn&rsquo;t
say &ldquo;Then sup with <i>me</i>!&rdquo; but the proof of it made
her feel as if she had feasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit hungry,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah you <i>must</i> be, awfully!&rdquo; he made answer, but
settling himself on the bench as if, after all, that needn&rsquo;t interfere
with his spending his evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always quite
wanted the chance to thank you for the trouble you so often take for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she replied; uttering the words with a
sense of the situation far deeper than any pretence of not fitting his
allusion.&nbsp; She immediately felt him surprised and even a little
puzzled at her frank assent; but for herself the trouble she had taken
could only, in these fleeting minutes&mdash;they would probably never
come back&mdash;be all there like a little hoard of gold in her lap.&nbsp;
Certainly he might look at it, handle it, take up the pieces.&nbsp;
Yet if he understood anything he must understand all.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
consider you&rsquo;ve already immensely thanked me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
horror was back upon her of having seemed to hang about for some reward.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully odd you should have been there just the one
time&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one time you&rsquo;ve passed my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you can fancy I haven&rsquo;t many minutes to waste.&nbsp;
There was a place to-night I had to stop at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I see&mdash;&rdquo; he knew already so much about her
work.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be an awful grind&mdash;for a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, but I don&rsquo;t think I groan over it any more than
my companions&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve seen <i>they&rsquo;re</i> not ladies!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She mildly jested, but with an intention.&nbsp; &ldquo;One gets used
to things, and there are employments I should have hated much more.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She had the finest conception of the beauty of not at least boring him.&nbsp;
To whine, to count up her wrongs, was what a barmaid or a shop-girl
would do, and it was quite enough to sit there like one of these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had had another employment,&rdquo; he remarked after
a moment, &ldquo;we might never have become acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s highly probable&mdash;and certainly not in the
same way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, still with her heap of gold in her lap
and something of the pride of it in her manner of holding her head,
she continued not to move&mdash;she only smiled at him.&nbsp; The evening
had thickened now; the scattered lamps were red; the Park, all before
them, was full of obscure and ambiguous life; there were other couples
on other benches whom it was impossible not to see, yet at whom it was
impossible to look.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve walked so much out of
my way with you only just to show you that&mdash;that&rdquo;&mdash;with
this she paused; it was not after all so easy to express&mdash;&ldquo;that
anything you may have thought is perfectly true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ve thought a tremendous lot!&rdquo; her companion
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mind my smoking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&nbsp; You always smoke <i>there</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your place?&nbsp; Oh yes, but here it&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said as he lighted a cigarette, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
just what it isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, that&rsquo;s because &lsquo;there&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
so wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re conscious of how wonderful it is?&rdquo;
she returned.</p>
<p>He jerked his handsome head in literal protest at a doubt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s exactly what I mean by my gratitude for all
your trouble.&nbsp; It has been just as if you took a particular interest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She only looked at him by way of answer in such sudden headlong embarrassment,
as she was quite aware, that while she remained silent he showed himself
checked by her expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;You <i>have</i>&mdash;haven&rsquo;t
you?&mdash;taken a particular interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh a particular interest!&rdquo; she quavered out, feeling
the whole thing&mdash;her headlong embarrassment&mdash;get terribly
the better of her, and wishing, with a sudden scare, all the more to
keep her emotion down.&nbsp; She maintained her fixed smile a moment
and turned her eyes over the peopled darkness, unconfused now, because
there was something much more confusing.&nbsp; This, with a fatal great
rush, was simply the fact that they were thus together.&nbsp; They were
near, near, and all she had imagined of that had only become more true,
more dreadful and overwhelming.&nbsp; She stared straight away in silence
till she felt she looked an idiot; then, to say something, to say nothing,
she attempted a sound which ended in a flood of tears.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>Her tears helped her really to dissimulate, for she had instantly,
in so public a situation, to recover herself.&nbsp; They had come and
gone in half a minute, and she immediately explained them.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&lsquo;s
only because I&rsquo;m tired.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that&mdash;it&rsquo;s
that!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she added a trifle incoherently: &ldquo;I shall
never see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah but why not?&rdquo;&nbsp; The mere tone in which her companion
asked this satisfied her once for all as to the amount of imagination
for which she could count on him.&nbsp; It was naturally not large:
it had exhausted itself in having arrived at what he had already touched
upon&mdash;the sense of an intention in her poor zeal at Cocker&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
But any deficiency of this kind was no fault in him: he wasn&rsquo;t
obliged to have an inferior cleverness&mdash;to have second-rate resources
and virtues.&nbsp; It had been as if he almost really believed she had
simply cried for fatigue, and he accordingly put in some kind confused
plea&mdash;&ldquo;You ought really to take something: won&rsquo;t you
have something or other <i>somewhere</i>?&rdquo; to which she had made
no response but a headshake of a sharpness that settled it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
shan&rsquo;t we all the more keep meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean meeting this way&mdash;only this way.&nbsp; At my place
there&mdash;<i>that</i> I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with, and I hope of
course you&rsquo;ll turn up, with your correspondence, when it suits
you.&nbsp; Whether I stay or not, I mean; for I shall probably not stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going somewhere else?&rdquo; he put it with positive
anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ever so far away&mdash;to the other end of London.&nbsp;
There are all sorts of reasons I can&rsquo;t tell you; and it&rsquo;s
practically settled.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better for me, much; and I&rsquo;ve
only kept on at Cocker&rsquo;s for <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making out in the dusk that he fairly blushed, she now measured how
far he had been from knowing too much.&nbsp; Too much, she called it
at present; and that was easy, since it proved so abundantly enough
for her that he should simply be where he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;As we shall
never talk this way but to-night&mdash;never, never again!&mdash;here
it all is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll say it; I don&rsquo;t care what you think;
it doesn&rsquo;t matter; I only want to help you.&nbsp; Besides, you&rsquo;re
kind&mdash;you&rsquo;re kind.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been thinking then of
leaving for ever so long.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ve come so often&mdash;at
times&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve had so much to do, and it has been so pleasant
and interesting, that I&rsquo;ve remained, I&rsquo;ve kept putting off
any change.&nbsp; More than once, when I had nearly decided, you&rsquo;ve
turned up again and I&rsquo;ve thought &lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the simple fact!&rdquo;&nbsp; She had by this time got her confusion
down so completely that she could laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is what I
meant when I said to you just now that I &lsquo;knew.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
known perfectly that you knew I took trouble for you; and that knowledge
has been for me, and I seemed to see it was for you, as if there were
something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to call it!&mdash;between us.&nbsp;
I mean something unusual and good and awfully nice&mdash;something not
a bit horrid or vulgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had by this time, she could see, produced a great effect on him;
but she would have spoken the truth to herself had she at the same moment
declared that she didn&rsquo;t in the least care: all the more that
the effect must be one of extreme perplexity.&nbsp; What, in it all,
was visibly clear for him, none the less, was that he was tremendously
glad he had met her.&nbsp; She held him, and he was astonished at the
force of it; he was intent, immensely considerate.&nbsp; His elbow was
on the back of the seat, and his head, with the pot-hat pushed quite
back, in a boyish way, so that she really saw almost for the first time
his forehead and hair, rested on the hand into which he had crumpled
his gloves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assented, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not a bit horrid or vulgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She just hung fire a moment, then she brought out the whole truth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d do anything for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never in her life had she known anything so high and
fine as this, just letting him have it and bravely and magnificently
leaving it.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t the place, the associations and circumstances,
perfectly make it sound what it wasn&rsquo;t? and wasn&rsquo;t that
exactly the beauty?</p>
<p>So she bravely and magnificently left it, and little by little she
felt him take it up, take it down, as if they had been on a satin sofa
in a boudoir.&nbsp; She had never seen a boudoir, but there had been
lots of boudoirs in the telegrams.&nbsp; What she had said at all events
sank into him, so that after a minute he simply made a movement that
had the result of placing his hand on her own&mdash;presently indeed
that of her feeling herself firmly enough grasped.&nbsp; There was no
pressure she need return, there was none she need decline; she just
sat admirably still, satisfied for the time with the surprise and bewilderment
of the impression she made on him.&nbsp; His agitation was even greater
on the whole than she had at first allowed for.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say,
you know, you mustn&rsquo;t think of leaving!&rdquo; he at last broke
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of leaving Cocker&rsquo;s, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must stay on there, whatever happens, and help a
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent a little, partly because it was so strange and exquisite
to feel him watch her as if it really mattered to him and he were almost
in suspense.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you <i>have</i> quite recognised what
I&rsquo;ve tried to do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, wasn&rsquo;t that exactly what I dashed over from my
door just now to thank you for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; so you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked down a moment at his hand, which continued to cover her
own; whereupon he presently drew it back, rather restlessly folding
his arms.&nbsp; Without answering his question she went on: &ldquo;Have
you ever spoken of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of my being there&mdash;of my knowing, and that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh never to a human creature!&rdquo; he eagerly declared.</p>
<p>She had a small drop at this, which was expressed in another pause,
and she then returned to what he had just asked her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh
yes, I quite believe you like it&mdash;my always being there and our
taking things up so familiarly and successfully: if not exactly where
we left them,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;almost always at least at an
interesting point!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was about to say something in reply
to this, but her friendly gaiety was quicker.&nbsp; &ldquo;You want
a great many things in life, a great many comforts and helps and luxuries&mdash;you
want everything as pleasant as possible.&nbsp; Therefore, so far as
it&rsquo;s in the power of any particular person to contribute to all
that&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She had turned her face to him smiling, just
thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh see here!&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was highly amused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo; he enquired as if to humour her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the particular person must never fail.&nbsp; We must manage
it for you somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw back his head, laughing out; he was really exhilarated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh yes, somehow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think we each do&mdash;don&rsquo;t we?&mdash;in one
little way and another and according to our limited lights.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
pleased at any rate, for myself, that you are; for I assure you I&rsquo;ve
done my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do better than any one!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had struck a match
for another cigarette, and the flame lighted an instant his responsive
finished face, magnifying into a pleasant grimace the kindness with
which he paid her this tribute.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully clever,
you know; cleverer, cleverer, cleverer&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had appeared
on the point of making some tremendous statement; then suddenly, puffing
his cigarette and shifting almost with violence on his seat, he let
it altogether fall.</p>

<p>In spite of this drop, if not just by reason of it, she felt as if
Lady Bradeen, all but named out, had popped straight up; and she practically
betrayed her consciousness by waiting a little before she rejoined:
&ldquo;Cleverer than who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I wasn&rsquo;t afraid you&rsquo;d think I swagger,
I should say&mdash;than anybody!&nbsp; If you leave your place there,
where shall you go?&rdquo; he more gravely asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh too far for you ever to find me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d find you anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone of this was so still more serious that she had but her one
acknowledgement.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything for you&mdash;I&rsquo;d
do anything for you,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; She had already, she
felt, said it all; so what did anything more, anything less, matter?&nbsp;
That was the very reason indeed why she could, with a lighter note,
ease him generously of any awkwardness produced by solemnity, either
his own or hers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course it must be nice for you to be
able to think there are people all about who feel in such a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In immediate appreciation of this, however, he only smoked without
looking at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t want to give up your
present work?&rdquo; he at last threw out.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean you <i>will</i>
stay in the post-office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I think I&rsquo;ve a genius for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&nbsp; No one can touch you.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this
he turned more to her again.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you can get, with a move,
greater advantages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get in the suburbs cheaper lodgings.&nbsp; I live with
my mother.&nbsp; We need some space.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a particular
place that has other inducements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He just hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh quite out of <i>your</i> way.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d never have
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you I&rsquo;d go anywhere.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for once or twice.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;d soon see it
wouldn&rsquo;t do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smoked and considered; seemed to stretch himself a little and,
with his legs out, surrender himself comfortably.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
well, well&mdash;I believe everything you say.&nbsp; I take it from
you&mdash;anything you like&mdash;in the most extraordinary way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It struck her certainly&mdash;and almost without bitterness&mdash;that
the way in which she was already, as if she had been an old friend,
arranging for him and preparing the only magnificence she could muster,
was quite the most extraordinary.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
go!&rdquo; he presently went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall miss you too horribly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that you just put it to me as a definite request?&rdquo;&mdash;oh
how she tried to divest this of all sound of the hardness of bargaining!&nbsp;
That ought to have been easy enough, for what was she arranging to get?&nbsp;
Before he could answer she had continued: &ldquo;To be perfectly fair
I should tell you I recognise at Cocker&rsquo;s certain strong attractions.&nbsp;
All you people come.&nbsp; I like all the horrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horrors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those you all&mdash;you know the set I mean, <i>your</i> set&mdash;show
me with as good a conscience as if I had no more feeling than a letter-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked quite excited at the way she put it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh they
don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m not stupid?&nbsp; No, how should
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, how should they?&rdquo; said the Captain sympathetically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;horrors&rsquo; rather strong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you <i>do</i> is rather strong!&rdquo; the girl promptly
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>I</i> do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your extravagance, your selfishness, your immorality, your
crimes,&rdquo; she pursued, without heeding his expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>say</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;her companion showed the queerest
stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like them, as I tell you&mdash;I revel in them.&nbsp; But
we needn&rsquo;t go into that,&rdquo; she quietly went on; &ldquo;for
all I get out of it is the harmless pleasure of knowing.&nbsp; I know,
I know, I know!&rdquo;&mdash;she breathed it ever so gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s what has been between us,&rdquo; he answered
much more simply.</p>
<p>She could enjoy his simplicity in silence, and for a moment she did
so.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I do stay because you want it&mdash;and I&rsquo;m
rather capable of that&mdash;there are two or three things I think you
ought to remember.&nbsp; One is, you know, that I&rsquo;m there sometimes
for days and weeks together without your ever coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ll come every day!&rdquo; he honestly cried.</p>
<p>She was on the point, at this, of imitating with her hand his movement
of shortly before; but she checked herself, and there was no want of
effect in her soothing substitute.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can you?&nbsp; How
can you?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had, too manifestly, only to look at it there,
in the vulgarly animated gloom, to see that he couldn&rsquo;t; and at
this point, by the mere action of his silence, everything they had so
definitely not named, the whole presence round which they had been circling,
became part of their reference, settled in solidly between them.&nbsp;
It was as if then for a minute they sat and saw it all in each other&rsquo;s
eyes, saw so much that there was no need of a pretext for sounding it
at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your danger, your danger&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her voice indeed trembled with it, and she could only for the moment
again leave it so.</p>
<p>During this moment he leaned back on the bench, meeting her in silence
and with a face that grew more strange.&nbsp; It grew so strange that
after a further instant she got straight up.&nbsp; She stood there as
if their talk were now over, and he just sat and watched her.&nbsp;
It was as if now&mdash;owing to the third person they had brought in&mdash;they
must be more careful; so that the most he could finally say was: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
where it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it is!&rdquo; the girl as guardedly replied.&nbsp;
He sat still, and she added: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give you up.&nbsp;
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye?&rdquo;&mdash;he appealed, but without moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see my way, but I won&rsquo;t give you
up,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;There.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It brought him with a jerk to his feet, tossing away his cigarette.&nbsp;
His poor face was flushed.&nbsp; &ldquo;See here&mdash;see here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t; but I must leave you now,&rdquo; she went
on as if not hearing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here&mdash;see here!&rdquo;&nbsp; He tried, from the bench,
to take her hand again.</p>
<p>But that definitely settled it for her: this would, after all, be
as bad as his asking her to supper.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t come
with me&mdash;no, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank back, quite blank, as if she had pushed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
mayn&rsquo;t see you home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; let me go.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked almost as if she
had struck him, but she didn&rsquo;t care; and the manner in which she
spoke&mdash;it was literally as if she were angry&mdash;had the force
of a command.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here&mdash;see here!&rdquo; he nevertheless pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give you up!&rdquo; she cried once more&mdash;this
time quite with passion; on which she got away from him as fast as she
could and left him staring after her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>Mr. Mudge had lately been so occupied with their famous &ldquo;plans&rdquo;
that he had neglected for a while the question of her transfer; but
down at Bournemouth, which had found itself selected as the field of
their recreation by a process consisting, it seemed, exclusively of
innumerable pages of the neatest arithmetic in a very greasy but most
orderly little pocket-book, the distracting possible melted away&mdash;the
fleeting absolute ruled the scene.&nbsp; The plans, hour by hour, were
simply superseded, and it was much of a rest to the girl, as she sat
on the pier and overlooked the sea and the company, to see them evaporate
in rosy fumes and to feel that from moment to moment there was less
left to cipher about.&nbsp; The week proves blissfully fine, and her
mother, at their lodgings&mdash;partly to her embarrassment and partly
to her relief&mdash;struck up with the landlady an alliance that left
the younger couple a great deal of freedom.&nbsp; This relative took
her pleasure of a week at Bournemouth in a stuffy back-kitchen and endless
talks; to that degree even that Mr. Mudge himself&mdash;habitually inclined
indeed to a scrutiny of all mysteries and to seeing, as he sometimes
admitted, too much in things&mdash;made remarks on it as he sat on the
cliff with his betrothed, or on the decks of steamers that conveyed
them, close-packed items in terrific totals of enjoyment, to the Isle
of Wight and the Dorset coast.</p>
<p>He had a lodging in another house, where he had speedily learned
the importance of keeping his eyes open, and he made no secret of his
suspecting that sinister mutual connivances might spring, under the
roof of his companions, from unnatural sociabilities.&nbsp; At the same
time he fully recognised that as a source of anxiety, not to say of
expense, his future mother-in law would have weighted them more by accompanying
their steps than by giving her hostess, in the interest of the tendency
they considered that they never mentioned, equivalent pledges as to
the tea-caddy and the jam-pot.&nbsp; These were the questions&mdash;these
indeed the familiar commodities&mdash;that he had now to put into the
scales; and his betrothed had in consequence, during her holiday, the
odd and yet pleasant and almost languid sense of an anticlimax.&nbsp;
She had become conscious of an extraordinary collapse, a surrender to
stillness and to retrospect.&nbsp; She cared neither to walk nor to
sail; it was enough for her to sit on benches and wonder at the sea
and taste the air and not be at Cocker&rsquo;s and not see the counter-clerk.&nbsp;
She still seemed to wait for something&mdash;something in the key of
the immense discussions that had mapped out their little week of idleness
on the scale of a world-atlas.&nbsp; Something came at last, but without
perhaps appearing quite adequately to crown the monument.</p>
<p>Preparation and precaution were, however, the natural flowers of
Mr. Mudge&rsquo;s mind, and in proportion as these things declined in
one quarter they inevitably bloomed elsewhere.&nbsp; He could always,
at the worst, have on Tuesday the project of their taking the Swanage
boat on Thursday, and on Thursday that of their ordering minced kidneys
on Saturday.&nbsp; He had moreover a constant gift of inexorable enquiry
as to where and what they should have gone and have done if they hadn&rsquo;t
been exactly as they were.&nbsp; He had in short his resources, and
his mistress had never been so conscious of them; on the other hand
they never interfered so little with her own.&nbsp; She liked to be
as she was&mdash;if it could only have lasted.&nbsp; She could accept
even without bitterness a rigour of economy so great that the little
fee they paid for admission to the pier had to be balanced against other
delights.&nbsp; The people at Ladle&rsquo;s and at Thrupp&rsquo;s had
<i>their</i> ways of amusing themselves, whereas she had to sit and
hear Mr. Mudge talk of what he might do if he didn&rsquo;t take a bath,
or of the bath he might take if he only hadn&rsquo;t taken something
else.&nbsp; He was always with her now, of course, always beside her;
she saw him more than &ldquo;hourly,&rdquo; more than ever yet, more
even than he had planned she should do at Chalk Farm.&nbsp; She preferred
to sit at the far end, away from the band and the crowd; as to which
she had frequent differences with her friend, who reminded her often
that they could have only in the thick of it the sense of the money
they were getting back.&nbsp; That had little effect on her, for she
got back her money by seeing many things, the things of the past year,
fall together and connect themselves, undergo the happy relegation that
transforms melancholy and misery, passion and effort, into experience
and knowledge.</p>
<p>She liked having done with them, as she assured herself she had practically
done, and the strange thing was that she neither missed the procession
now nor wished to keep her place for it.&nbsp; It had become there,
in the sun and the breeze and the sea-smell, a far-away story, a picture
of another life.&nbsp; If Mr. Mudge himself liked processions, liked
them at Bournemouth and on the pier quite as much as at Chalk Farm or
anywhere, she learned after a little not to be worried by his perpetual
counting of the figures that made them up.&nbsp; There were dreadful
women in particular, usually fat and in men&rsquo;s caps and write shoes,
whom he could never let alone&mdash;not that she cared; it was not the
great world, the world of Cocker&rsquo;s and Ladle&rsquo;s and Thrupp&rsquo;s,
but it offered an endless field to his faculties of memory, philosophy,
and frolic.&nbsp; She had never accepted him so much, never arranged
so successfully for making him chatter while she carried on secret conversations.&nbsp;
This separate commerce was with herself; and if they both practised
a great thrift she had quite mastered that of merely spending words
enough to keep him imperturbably and continuously going.</p>
<p>He was charmed with the panorama, not knowing&mdash;or at any rate
not at all showing that he knew&mdash;what far other images peopled
her mind than the women in the navy caps and the shop-boys in the blazers.&nbsp;
His observations on these types, his general interpretation of the show,
brought home to her the prospect of Chalk Farm.&nbsp; She wondered sometimes
that he should have derived so little illumination, during his period,
from the society at Cocker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But one evening while their
holiday cloudlessly waned he gave her such a proof of his quality as
might have made her ashamed of her many suppressions.&nbsp; He brought
out something that, in all his overflow, he had been able to keep back
till other matters were disposed of.&nbsp; It was the announcement that
he was at last ready to marry&mdash;that he saw his way.&nbsp; A rise
at Chalk Farm had been offered him; he was to be taken into the business,
bringing with him a capital the estimation of which by other parties
constituted the handsomest recognition yet made of the head on his shoulders.&nbsp;
Therefore their waiting was over&mdash;it could be a question of a near
date.&nbsp; They would settle this date before going back, and he meanwhile
had his eye on a sweet little home.&nbsp; He would take her to see it
on their first Sunday.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>His having kept this great news for the last, having had such a card
up his sleeve and not floated it out in the current of his chatter and
the luxury of their leisure, was one of those incalculable strokes by
which he could still affect her; the kind of thing that reminded her
of the latent force that had ejected the drunken soldier&mdash;an example
of the profundity of which his promotion was the proof.&nbsp; She listened
a while in silence, on this occasion, to the wafted strains of the music;
she took it in as she had not quite done before that her future was
now constituted.&nbsp; Mr. Mudge was distinctly her fate; yet at this
moment she turned her face quite away from him, showing him so long
a mere quarter of her cheek that she at last again heard his voice.&nbsp;
He couldn&rsquo;t see a pair of tears that were partly the reason of
her delay to give him the assurance he required; but he expressed at
a venture the hope that she had had her fill of Cocker&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She was finally able to turn back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh quite.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
nothing going on.&nbsp; No one comes but the Americans at Thrupp&rsquo;s,
and they don&rsquo;t do much.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t seem to have a
secret in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the extraordinary reason you&rsquo;ve been giving me
for holding on there has ceased to work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, that one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
seen the thing through&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got them all in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re ready to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a little again she made no answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, not yet,
all the same.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve still got a reason&mdash;a different
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked her all over as if it might have been something she kept
in her mouth or her glove or under her jacket&mdash;something she was
even sitting upon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have it, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went out the other night and sat in the Park with a gentleman,&rdquo;
she said at last.</p>
<p>Nothing was ever seen like his confidence in her and she wondered
a little now why it didn&rsquo;t irritate her.&nbsp; It only gave her
ease and space, as she felt, for telling him the whole truth that no
one knew.&nbsp; It had arrived at present at her really wanting to do
that, and yet to do it not in the least for Mr. Mudge, but altogether
and only for herself.&nbsp; This truth filled out for her there the
whole experience about to relinquish, suffused and coloured it as a
picture that she should keep and that, describe it as she might, no
one but herself would ever really see.&nbsp; Moreover she had no desire
whatever to make Mr. Mudge jealous; there would be no amusement in it,
for the amusement she had lately known had spoiled her for lower pleasures.&nbsp;
There were even no materials for it.&nbsp; The odd thing was how she
never doubted that, properly handled, his passion was poisonable; what
had happened was that he had cannily selected a partner with no poison
to distil.&nbsp; She read then and there that she should never interest
herself in anybody as to whom some other sentiment, some superior view,
wouldn&rsquo;t be sure to interfere for him with jealousy.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
what did you get out of that?&rdquo; he asked with a concern that was
not in the least for his honour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a good chance to promise him I wouldn&rsquo;t
forsake him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s one of my customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s for him not to forsake <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; But
I must just keep on as long as he may want me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want you to sit with him in the Park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may want me for that&mdash;but I shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I
rather liked it, but once, under the circumstances, is enough.&nbsp;
I can do better for him in another manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what manner, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsewhere?&mdash;I <i>say</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was an ejaculation used also by Captain Everard, but oh with
what a different sound!&nbsp; &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t &lsquo;say&rsquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s
nothing to be said.&nbsp; And yet you ought perhaps to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I ought.&nbsp; But <i>what</i>&mdash;up to now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why exactly what I told him.&nbsp; That I&rsquo;d do anything
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;anything&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mudge&rsquo;s immediate comment on this statement was to draw
from his pocket a crumpled paper containing the remains of half a pound
of &ldquo;sundries.&rdquo;&nbsp; These sundries had figured conspicuously
in his prospective sketch of their tour, but it was only at the end
of three days that they had defined themselves unmistakeably as chocolate-creams.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have another?&mdash;<i>that</i> one,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; She
had another, but not the one he indicated, and then he continued: &ldquo;What
took place afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do when you had told him you&rsquo;d do everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the Park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, leaving him there.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t let him follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what did you let him do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t let him do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mudge considered an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then what did you go
there for?&rdquo;&nbsp; His tone was even slightly critical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite know at the time.&nbsp; It was simply
to be with him, I suppose&mdash;just once.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s in danger,
and I wanted him to know I know it.&nbsp; It makes meeting him&mdash;at
Cocker&rsquo;s, since it&rsquo;s that I want to stay on for&mdash;more
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes it mighty interesting for <i>me</i>!&rdquo; Mr. Mudge
freely declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet he didn&rsquo;t follow you?&rdquo;
he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I</i> would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&nbsp; That was the way you began, you know.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re awfully inferior to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, you&rsquo;re not inferior to anybody.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got a cheek!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s he in danger of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of being found out.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s in love with a lady&mdash;and
it isn&rsquo;t right&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve found him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be a look-out for <i>me</i>!&rdquo; Mr. Mudge
joked.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean she has a husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what she has!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re in awful danger,
but his is the worst, because he&rsquo;s in danger from her too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like me from you&mdash;the woman <i>I</i> love?&nbsp; If he&rsquo;s
in the same funk as me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a worse one.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not only afraid
of the lady&mdash;he&rsquo;s afraid of other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mudge selected another chocolate-cream.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m
only afraid of one!&nbsp; But how in the world can you help this party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;perhaps not at all.&nbsp; But so
long as there&rsquo;s a chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ve got to wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mudge enjoyed what was in his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what will
he give you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; Nothing in all the wide world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what will he give <i>me</i>?&rdquo; Mr. Mudge enquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I mean for waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl thought a moment; then she got up to walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
never heard of you,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t mentioned me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never mention anything.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;ve told you
is just what I&rsquo;ve found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mudge, who had remained on the bench, looked up at her; she often
preferred to be quiet when he proposed to walk, but now that he seemed
to wish to sit she had a desire to move.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t
told me what <i>he</i> has found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered her lover.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d never find <i>you</i>,
my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lover, still on his seat, appealed to her in something of the
attitude in which she had last left Captain Everard, but the impression
was not the same.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then where do I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t come in at all.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just the
beauty of it!&rdquo;&mdash;and with this she turned to mingle with the
multitude collected round the band.&nbsp; Mr. Mudge presently overtook
her and drew her arm into his own with a quiet force that expressed
the serenity of possession; in consonance with which it was only when
they parted for the night at her door that he referred again to what
she had told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the night in the Park?&nbsp; No, not once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a cad!&rdquo; said Mr. Mudge.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>It was not till the end of October that she saw Captain Everard again,
and on that occasion&mdash;the only one of all the series on which hindrance
had been so utter&mdash;no communication with him proved possible.&nbsp;
She had made out even from the cage that it was a charming golden day:
a patch of hazy autumn sunlight lay across the sanded floor and also,
higher up, quickened into brightness a row of ruddy bottled syrups.&nbsp;
Work was slack and the place in general empty; the town, as they said
in the cage, had not waked up, and the feeling of the day likened itself
to something than in happier conditions she would have thought of romantically
as Saint Martin&rsquo;s summer.&nbsp; The counter-clerk had gone to
his dinner; she herself was busy with arrears of postal jobs, in the
midst of which she became aware that Captain Everard had apparently
been in the shop a minute and that Mr. Buckton had already seized him.</p>
<p>He had as usual half a dozen telegrams; and when he saw that she
saw him and their eyes met he gave, on bowing to her, an exaggerated
laugh in which she read a new consciousness.&nbsp; It was a confession
of awkwardness; it seemed to tell her that of course he knew he ought
better to have kept his head, ought to have been clever enough to wait,
on some pretext, till he should have found her free.&nbsp; Mr. Buckton
was a long time with him, and her attention was soon demanded by other
visitors; so that nothing passed between them but the fulness of their
silence.&nbsp; The look she took from him was his greeting, and the
other one a simple sign of the eyes sent her before going out.&nbsp;
The only token they exchanged therefore was his tacit assent to her
wish that since they couldn&rsquo;t attempt a certain frankness they
should attempt nothing at all.&nbsp; This was her intense preference;
she could be as still and cold as any one when that was the sole solution.</p>
<p>Yet more than any contact hitherto achieved these counted instants
struck her as marking a step: they were built so&mdash;just in the mere
flash&mdash;on the recognition of his now definitely knowing what it
was she would do for him.&nbsp; The &ldquo;anything, anything&rdquo;
she had uttered in the Park went to and fro between them and under the
poked-out china that interposed.&nbsp; It had all at last even put on
the air of their not needing now clumsily to manoeuvre to converse:
their former little postal make-believes, the intense implications of
questions and answers and change, had become in the light of the personal
fact, of their having had their moment, a possibility comparatively
poor.&nbsp; It was as if they had met for all time&mdash;it exerted
on their being in presence again an influence so prodigious.&nbsp; When
she watched herself, in the memory of that night, walk away from him
as if she were making an end, she found something too pitiful in the
primness of such a gait.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t she precisely established
on the part of each a consciousness that could end only with death?</p>
<p>It must be admitted that in spite of this brave margin an irritation,
after he had gone, remained with her; a sense that presently became
one with a still sharper hatred of Mr. Buckton, who, on her friend&rsquo;s
withdrawal, had retired with the telegrams to the sounder and left her
the other work.&nbsp; She knew indeed she should have a chance to see
them, when she would, on file; and she was divided, as the day went
on, between the two impressions of all that was lost and all that was
re-asserted.&nbsp; What beset her above all, and as she had almost never
known it before, was the desire to bound straight out, to overtake the
autumn afternoon before it passed away for ever and hurry off to the
Park and perhaps be with him there again on a bench.&nbsp; It became
for an hour a fantastic vision with her that he might just have gone
to sit and wait for her.&nbsp; She could almost hear him, through the
tick of the sounder, scatter with his stick, in his impatience, the
fallen leaves of October.&nbsp; Why should such a vision seize her at
this particular moment with such a shake?&nbsp; There was a time&mdash;from
four to five&mdash;when she could have cried with happiness and rage.</p>
<p>Business quickened, it seemed, toward five, as if the town did wake
up; she had therefore more to do, and she went through it with little
sharp stampings and jerkings: she made the crisp postal-orders fairly
snap while she breathed to herself &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last day&mdash;the
last day!&rdquo;&nbsp; The last day of what?&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t
have told.&nbsp; All she knew now was that if she <i>were</i> out of
the cage she wouldn&rsquo;t in the least have minded, this time, its
not yet being dark.&nbsp; She would have gone straight toward Park Chambers
and have hung about there till no matter when.&nbsp; She would have
waited, stayed, rung, asked, have gone in, sat on the stairs.&nbsp;
What the day was the last of was probably, to her strained inner sense,
the group of golden ones, of any occasion for seeing the hazy sunshine
slant at that angle into the smelly shop, of any range of chances for
his wishing still to repeat to her the two words she had in the Park
scarcely let him bring out.&nbsp; &ldquo;See here&mdash;see here!&rdquo;&mdash;the
sound of these two words had been with her perpetually; but it was in
her ears to-day without mercy, with a loudness that grew and grew.&nbsp;
What was it they then expressed? what was it he had wanted her to see?&nbsp;
She seemed, whatever it was, perfectly to see it now&mdash;to see that
if she should just chuck the whole thing, should have a great and beautiful
courage, he would somehow make everything up to her.&nbsp; When the
clock struck five she was on the very point of saying to Mr. Buckton
that she was deadly ill and rapidly getting worse.&nbsp; This announcement
was on her lips, and she had quite composed the pale hard face she would
offer him: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop&mdash;I must go home.&nbsp; If
I feel better, later on, I&rsquo;ll come back.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very
sorry, but I <i>must</i> go.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that instant Captain Everard
once more stood there, producing in her agitated spirit, by his real
presence, the strangest, quickest revolution.&nbsp; He stopped her off
without knowing it, and by the time he had been a minute in the shop
she felt herself saved.</p>
<p>That was from the first minute how she thought of it.&nbsp; There
were again other persons with whom she was occupied, and again the situation
could only be expressed by their silence.&nbsp; It was expressed, of
a truth, in a larger phrase than ever yet, for her eyes now spoke to
him with a kind of supplication.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be quiet, be quiet!&rdquo;
they pleaded; and they saw his own reply: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever
you say; I won&rsquo;t even look at you&mdash;see, see!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They kept conveying thus, with the friendliest liberality, that they
wouldn&rsquo;t look, quite positively wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; What she
was to see was that he hovered at the other end of the counter, Mr.
Buckton&rsquo;s end, and surrendered himself again to that frustration.&nbsp;
It quickly proved so great indeed that what she was to see further was
how he turned away before he was attended to, and hung off, waiting,
smoking, looking about the shop; how he went over to Mr. Cocker&rsquo;s
own counter and appeared to price things, gave in fact presently two
or three orders and put down money, stood there a long time with his
back to her, considerately abstaining from any glance round to see if
she were free.&nbsp; It at last came to pass in this way that he had
remained in the shop longer than she had ever yet known to do, and that,
nevertheless, when he did turn about she could see him time himself&mdash;she
was freshly taken up&mdash;and cross straight to her postal subordinate,
whom some one else had released.&nbsp; He had in his hand all this while
neither letters nor telegrams, and now that he was close to her&mdash;for
she was close to the counter-clerk&mdash;it brought her heart into her
mouth merely to see him look at her neighbour and open his lips.&nbsp;
She was too nervous to bear it.&nbsp; He asked for a Post-Office Guide,
and the young man whipped out a new one; whereupon he said he wished
not to purchase, but only to consult one a moment; with which, the copy
kept on loan being produced, he once more wandered off.</p>
<p>What was he doing to her?&nbsp; What did he want of her?&nbsp; Well,
it was just the aggravation of his &ldquo;See here!&rdquo;&nbsp; She
felt at this moment strangely and portentously afraid of him&mdash;had
in her ears the hum of a sense that, should it come to that kind of
tension, she must fly on the spot to Chalk Farm.&nbsp; Mixed with her
dread and with her reflexion was the idea that, if he wanted her so
much as he seemed to show, it might be after all simply to do for him
the &ldquo;anything&rdquo; she had promised, the &ldquo;everything&rdquo;
she had thought it so fine to bring out to Mr. Mudge.&nbsp; He might
want her to help him, might have some particular appeal; though indeed
his manner didn&rsquo;t denote that&mdash;denoted on the contrary an
embarrassment, an indecision, something of a desire not so much to be
helped as to be treated rather more nicely than she had treated him
the other time.&nbsp; Yes, he considered quite probably that he had
help rather to offer than to ask for.&nbsp; Still, none the less, when
he again saw her free he continued to keep away from her; when he came
back with his thumbed Guide it was Mr. Buckton he caught&mdash;it was
from Mr. Buckton he obtained half-a-crown&rsquo;s-worth of stamps.</p>
<p>After asking for the stamps he asked, quite as a second thought,
for a postal-order for ten shillings.&nbsp; What did he want with so
many stamps when he wrote so few letters?&nbsp; How could he enclose
a postal-order in a telegram?&nbsp; She expected him, the next thing,
to go into the corner and make up one of his telegrams&mdash;half a
dozen of them&mdash;on purpose to prolong his presence.&nbsp; She had
so completely stopped looking at him that she could only guess his movements&mdash;guess
even where his eyes rested.&nbsp; Finally she saw him make a dash that
might have been toward the nook where the forms were hung; and at this
she suddenly felt that she couldn&rsquo;t keep it up.&nbsp; The counter-clerk
had just taken a telegram from a slavey, and, to give herself something
to cover her, she snatched it out of his hand.&nbsp; The gesture was
so violent that he gave her in return an odd look, and she also perceived
that Mr. Buckton noticed it.&nbsp; The latter personage, with a quick
stare at her, appeared for an instant to wonder whether his snatching
it in <i>his</i> turn mightn&rsquo;t be the thing she would least like,
and she anticipated this practical criticism by the frankest glare she
had ever given him.&nbsp; It sufficed: this time it paralysed him; and
she sought with her trophy the refuge of the sounder.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>It was repeated the next day; it went on for three days; and at the
end of that time she knew what to think.&nbsp; When, at the beginning,
she had emerged from her temporary shelter Captain Everard had quitted
the shop; and he had not come again that evening, as it had struck her
he possibly might&mdash;might all the more easily that there were numberless
persons who came, morning and afternoon, numberless times, so that he
wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have attracted attention.&nbsp; The second
day it was different and yet on the whole worse.&nbsp; His access to
her had become possible&mdash;she felt herself even reaping the fruit
of her yesterday&rsquo;s glare at Mr. Buckton; but transacting his business
with him didn&rsquo;t simplify&mdash;it could, in spite of the rigour
of circumstance, feed so her new conviction.&nbsp; The rigour was tremendous,
and his telegrams&mdash;not now mere pretexts for getting at her&mdash;were
apparently genuine; yet the conviction had taken but a night to develop.&nbsp;
It could be simply enough expressed; she had had the glimmer of it the
day before in her idea that he needed no more help than she had already
given; that it was help he himself was prepared to render.&nbsp; He
had come up to town but for three or four days; he had been absolutely
obliged to be absent after the other time; yet he would, now that he
was face to face with her, stay on as much longer as she liked.&nbsp;
Little by little it was thus clarified, though from the first flash
of his re-appearance she had read into it the real essence.</p>
<p>That was what the night before, at eight o&rsquo;clock, her hour
to go, had made her hang back and dawdle.&nbsp; She did last things
or pretended to do them; to be in the cage had suddenly become her safety,
and she was literally afraid of the alternate self who might be waiting
outside.&nbsp; <i>He</i> might be waiting; it was he who was her alternate
self, and of him she was afraid.&nbsp; The most extraordinary change
had taken place in her from the moment of her catching the impression
he seemed to have returned on purpose to give her.&nbsp; Just before
she had done so, on that bewitched afternoon, she had seen herself approach
without a scruple the porter at Park Chambers; then as the effect of
the rush of a consciousness quite altered she had on at last quitting
Cocker&rsquo;s, gone straight home for the first time since her return
from Bournemouth.&nbsp; She had passed his door every night for weeks,
but nothing would have induced her to pass it now.&nbsp; This change
was the tribute of her fear&mdash;the result of a change in himself
as to which she needed no more explanation than his mere face vividly
gave her; strange though it was to find an element of deterrence in
the object that she regarded as the most beautiful in the world.&nbsp;
He had taken it from her in the Park that night that she wanted him
not to propose to her to sup; but he had put away the lesson by this
time&mdash;he practically proposed supper every time he looked at her.&nbsp;
This was what, for that matter, mainly filled the three days.&nbsp;
He came in twice on each of these, and it was as if he came in to give
her a chance to relent.&nbsp; That was after all, she said to herself
in the intervals, the most that he did.&nbsp; There were ways, she fully
recognised, in which he spared her, and other particular ways as to
which she meant that her silence should be full to him of exquisite
pleading.&nbsp; The most particular of all was his not being outside,
at the corner, when she quitted the place for the night.&nbsp; This
he might so easily have been&mdash;so easily if he hadn&rsquo;t been
so nice.&nbsp; She continued to recognise in his forbearance the fruit
of her dumb supplication, and the only compensation he found for it
was the harmless freedom of being able to appear to say: &ldquo;Yes,
I&rsquo;m in town only for three or four days, but, you know, I <i>would</i>
stay on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He struck her as calling attention each day, each
hour, to the rapid ebb of time; he exaggerated to the point of putting
it that there were only two days more, that there was at last, dreadfully,
only one.</p>
<p>There were other things still that he struck her as doing with a
special intention; as to the most marked of which&mdash;unless indeed
it were the most obscure&mdash;she might well have marvelled that it
didn&rsquo;t seem to her more horrid.&nbsp; It was either the frenzy
of her imagination or the disorder of his baffled passion that gave
her once or twice the vision of his putting down redundant money&mdash;sovereigns
not concerned with the little payments he was perpetually making&mdash;so
that she might give him some sign of helping him to slip them over to
her.&nbsp; What was most extraordinary in this impression was the amount
of excuse that, with some incoherence, she found for him.&nbsp; He wanted
to pay her because there was nothing to pay her for.&nbsp; He wanted
to offer her things he knew she wouldn&rsquo;t take.&nbsp; He wanted
to show her how much he respected her by giving her the supreme chance
to show <i>him</i> she was respectable.&nbsp; Over the dryest transactions,
at any rate, their eyes had out these questions.&nbsp; On the third
day he put in a telegram that had evidently something of the same point
as the stray sovereigns&mdash;a message that was in the first place
concocted and that on a second thought he took back from her before
she had stamped it.&nbsp; He had given her time to read it and had only
then bethought himself that he had better not send it.&nbsp; If it was
not to Lady Bradeen at Twindle&mdash;where she knew her ladyship then
to be&mdash;this was because an address to Doctor Buzzard at Brickwood
was just as good, with the added merit of its not giving away quite
so much a person whom he had still, after all, in a manner to consider.&nbsp;
It was of course most complicated, only half lighted; but there was,
discernibly enough, a scheme of communication in which Lady Bradeen
at Twindle and Dr. Buzzard at Brickwood were, within limits, one and
the same person.&nbsp; The words he had shown her and then taken back
consisted, at all events, of the brief but vivid phrase &ldquo;Absolutely
impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; The point was not that she should transmit
it; the point was just that she should see it.&nbsp; What was absolutely
impossible was that before he had setted something at Cocker&rsquo;s
he should go either to Twindle or to Brickwood.</p>
<p>The logic of this, in turn, for herself, was that she could lend
herself to no settlement so long as she so intensely knew.&nbsp; What
she knew was that he was, almost under peril of life, clenched in a
situation: therefore how could she also know where a poor girl in the
P.O. might really stand?&nbsp; It was more and more between them that
if he might convey to her he was free, with all the impossible locked
away into a closed chapter, her own case might become different for
her, she might understand and meet him and listen.&nbsp; But he could
convey nothing of the sort, and he only fidgeted and floundered in his
want of power.&nbsp; The chapter wasn&rsquo;t in the least closed, not
for the other party; and the other party had a pull, somehow and somewhere:
this his whole attitude and expression confessed, at the same time that
they entreated her not to remember and not to mind.&nbsp; So long as
she did remember and did mind he could only circle about and go and
come, doing futile things of which he was ashamed.&nbsp; He was ashamed
of his two words to Dr. Buzzard; he went out of the shop as soon as
he had crumpled up the paper again and thrust it into his pocket.&nbsp;
It had been an abject little exposure of dreadful impossible passion.&nbsp;
He appeared in fact to be too ashamed to come back.&nbsp; He had once
more left town, and a first week elapsed, and a second.&nbsp; He had
had naturally to return to the real mistress of his fate; she had insisted&mdash;she
knew how to insist, and he couldn&rsquo;t put in another hour.&nbsp;
There was always a day when she called time.&nbsp; It was known to our
young friend moreover that he had now been dispatching telegrams from
other offices.&nbsp; She knew at last so much that she had quite lost
her earlier sense of merely guessing.&nbsp; There were no different
shades of distinctness&mdash;it all bounced out.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>Eighteen days elapsed, and she had begun to think it probable she
should never see him again.&nbsp; He too then understood now: he had
made out that she had secrets and reasons and impediments, that even
a poor girl at the P.O. might have her complications.&nbsp; With the
charm she had cast on him lightened by distance he had suffered a final
delicacy to speak to him, had made up his mind that it would be only
decent to let her alone.&nbsp; Never so much as during these latter
days had she felt the precariousness of their relation&mdash;the happy
beautiful untroubled original one, if it could only have been restored&mdash;in
which the public servant and the casual public only were concerned.&nbsp;
It hung at the best by the merest silken thread, which was at the mercy
of any accident and might snap at any minute.&nbsp; She arrived by the
end of the fortnight at the highest sense of actual fitness, never doubting
that her decision was now complete.&nbsp; She would just give him a
few days more to come back to her on a proper impersonal basis&mdash;for
even to an embarrassing representative of the casual public a public
servant with a conscience did owe something&mdash;and then would signify
to Mr. Mudge that she was ready for the little home.&nbsp; It had been
visited, in the further talk she had had with him at Bournemouth, from
garret to cellar, and they had especially lingered, with their respectively
darkened brows, before the niche into which it was to be broached to
her mother that she must find means to fit.</p>
<p>He had put it to her more definitely than before that his calculations
had allowed for that dingy presence, and he had thereby marked the greatest
impression he had ever made on her.&nbsp; It was a stroke superior even
again to his handling of the drunken soldier.&nbsp; What she considered
that in the face of it she hung on at Cocker&rsquo;s for was something
she could only have described as the common fairness of a last word.&nbsp;
Her actual last word had been, till it should be superseded, that she
wouldn&rsquo;t forsake her other friend, and it stuck to her through
thick and thin that she was still at her post and on her honour.&nbsp;
This other friend had shown so much beauty of conduct already that he
would surely after all just re-appear long enough to relieve her, to
give her something she could take away.&nbsp; She saw it, caught it,
at times, his parting present; and there were moments when she felt
herself sitting like a beggar with a hand held out to almsgiver who
only fumbled.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t taken the sovereigns, but she <i>would</i>
take the penny.&nbsp; She heard, in imagination, on the counter, the
ring of the copper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourself out any longer,&rdquo;
he would say, &ldquo;for so bad a case.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve done all
there is to be done.&nbsp; I thank and acquit and release you.&nbsp;
Our lives take us.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know much&mdash;though I&rsquo;ve
really been interested&mdash;about yours, but I suppose you&rsquo;ve
got one.&nbsp; Mine at any rate will take <i>me</i>&mdash;and where
it will.&nbsp; Heigh-ho!&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then once
more, for the sweetest faintest flower of all: &ldquo;Only, I say&mdash;see
here!&rdquo;&nbsp; She had framed the whole picture with a squareness
that included also the image of how again she would decline to &ldquo;see
there,&rdquo; decline, as she might say, to see anywhere, see anything.&nbsp;
Yet it befell that just in the fury of this escape she saw more than
ever.</p>
<p>He came back one night with a rush, near the moment of their closing,
and showed her a face so different and new, so upset and anxious, that
almost anything seemed to look out of it but clear recognition.&nbsp;
He poked in a telegram very much as if the simple sense of pressure,
the distress of extreme haste, had blurred the remembrance of where
in particular he was.&nbsp; But as she met his eyes a light came; it
broke indeed on the spot into a positive conscious glare.&nbsp; That
made up for everything, since it was an instant proclamation of the
celebrated &ldquo;danger&rdquo;; it seemed to pour things out in a flood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh yes, here it is&mdash;it&rsquo;s upon me at last!&nbsp; Forget,
for God&rsquo;s sake, my having worried or bored you, and just help
me, just <i>save</i> me, by getting this off without the loss of a second!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Something grave had clearly occurred, a crisis declared itself.&nbsp;
She recognised immediately the person to whom the telegram was addressed&mdash;the
Miss Dolman of Parade Lodge to whom Lady Bradeen had wired, at Dover,
on the last occasion, and whom she had then, with her recollection of
previous arrangements, fitted into a particular setting.&nbsp; Miss
Dolman had figured before and not figured since, but she was now the
subject of an imperative appeal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Absolutely necessary to
see you.&nbsp; Take last train Victoria if you can catch it.&nbsp; If
not, earliest morning, and answer me direct either way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reply paid?&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; Mr. Buckton had just
departed and the counter-clerk was at the sounder.&nbsp; There was no
other representative of the public, and she had never yet, as it seemed
to her, not even in the street or in the Park, been so alone with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, reply paid, and as sharp as possible, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She affixed the stamps in a flash.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll catch
the train!&rdquo; she then declared to him breathlessly, as if she could
absolutely guarantee it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I hope so.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s awfully
important.&nbsp; So kind of you.&nbsp; Awfully sharp, please.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was wonderfully innocent now, his oblivion of all but his danger.&nbsp;
Anything else that had ever passed between them was utterly out of it.&nbsp;
Well, she had wanted him to be impersonal!</p>
<p>There was less of the same need therefore, happily, for herself;
yet she only took time, before she flew to the sounder, to gasp at him:
&ldquo;You&lsquo;re in trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrid, horrid&mdash;there&rsquo;s a row!&rdquo;&nbsp; But
they parted, on it, in the next breath; and as she dashed at the sounder,
almost pushing, in her violence, the counter-clerk off the stool, she
caught the bang with which, at Cocker&rsquo;s door, in his further precipitation,
he closed the apron of the cab into which he had leaped.&nbsp; As he
rebounded to some other precaution suggested by his alarm, his appeal
to Miss Dolman flashed straight away.</p>
<p>But she had not, on the morrow, been in the place five minutes before
he was with her again, still more discomposed and quite, now, as she
said to herself, like a frightened child coming to its mother.&nbsp;
Her companions were there, and she felt it to be remarkable how, in
the presence of his agitation, his mere scared exposed nature, she suddenly
ceased to mind.&nbsp; It came to her as it had never come to her before
that with absolute directness and assurance they might carry almost
anything off.&nbsp; He had nothing to send&mdash;she was sure he had
been wiring all over&mdash;and yet his business was evidently huge.&nbsp;
There was nothing but that in his eyes&mdash;not a glimmer of reference
or memory.&nbsp; He was almost haggard with anxiety and had clearly
not slept a wink.&nbsp; Her pity for him would have given her any courage,
and she seemed to know at last why she had been such a fool.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
didn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, she came; but there has been some mistake.&nbsp; We
want a telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One that was sent from here ever so long ago.&nbsp; There
was something in it that has to be recovered.&nbsp; Something very,
very important, please&mdash;we want it immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He really spoke to her as if she had been some strange young woman
at Knightsbridge or Paddington; but it had no other effect on her than
to give her the measure of his tremendous flurry.&nbsp; Then it was
that, above all, she felt how much she had missed in the gaps and blanks
and absent answers&mdash;how much she had had to dispense with: it was
now black darkness save for this little wild red flare.&nbsp; So much
as that she saw, so much her mind dealt with.&nbsp; One of the lovers
was quaking somewhere out of town, and the other was quaking just where
he stood.&nbsp; This was vivid enough, and after an instant she knew
it was all she wanted.&nbsp; She wanted no detail, no fact&mdash;she
wanted no nearer vision of discovery or shame.&nbsp; &ldquo;When was
your telegram?&nbsp; Do you mean you sent it from here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
She tried to do the young woman at Knightsbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, from here&mdash;several weeks ago.&nbsp; Five, six,
seven&rdquo;&mdash;he was confused and impatient&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember?&rdquo; she could scarcely keep out of her face,
at the word, the strangest of smiles.</p>
<p>But the way he didn&rsquo;t catch what it meant was perhaps even
stranger still.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean, don&rsquo;t you keep the old ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a certain time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought; she must do the young woman, and she knew exactly what
the young woman would say and, still more, wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can
you give me the date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh God, no!&nbsp; It was some time or other in August&mdash;toward
the end.&nbsp; It was to the same address as the one I gave you last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the girl, knowing at this the deepest thrill
she had ever felt.&nbsp; It came to her there, with her eyes on his
face, that she held the whole thing in her hand, held it as she held
her pencil, which might have broken at that instant in her tightened
grip.&nbsp; This made her feel like the very fountain of fate, but the
emotion was such a flood that she had to press it back with all her
force.&nbsp; That was positively the reason, again, of her flute-like
Paddington tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t give us anything a little
nearer?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her &ldquo;little&rdquo; and her &ldquo;us&rdquo;
came straight from Paddington.&nbsp; These things were no false note
for him&mdash;his difficulty absorbed them all.&nbsp; The eyes with
which he pressed her, and in the depths of which she read terror and
rage and literal tears, were just the same he would have shown any other
prim person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the date.&nbsp; I only know the thing went
from here, and just about the time I speak of.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t
delivered, you see.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to recover it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>She was as struck with the beauty of his plural pronoun as she had
judged he might be with that of her own; but she knew now so well what
she was about that she could almost play with him and with her new-born
joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You say &lsquo;about the time you speak of.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But I don&rsquo;t think you speak of an exact time&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked splendidly helpless.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what
I want to find out.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you keep the old ones?&mdash;can&rsquo;t
you look it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young lady&mdash;still at Paddington&mdash;turned the question
over.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t delivered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it <i>was</i>; yet, at the same time, don&rsquo;t you
know? it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; He just hung back, but he brought
it out.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean it was intercepted, don&rsquo;t you know?
and there was something in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused again and, as
if to further his quest and woo and supplicate success and recovery,
even smiled with an effort at the agreeable that was almost ghastly
and that turned the knife in her tenderness.&nbsp; What must be the
pain of it all, of the open gulf and the throbbing fever, when this
was the mere hot breath?&nbsp; &ldquo;We want to get what was in it&mdash;to
know what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;I see.&rdquo;&nbsp; She managed just the accent
they had at Paddington when they stared like dead fish.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you have no clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;I&rsquo;ve the clue I&rsquo;ve just given
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh the last of August?&rdquo;&nbsp; If she kept it up long
enough she would make him really angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the address, as I&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh the same as last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He visibly quivered, as with a gleam of hope; but it only poured
oil on her quietude, and she was still deliberate.&nbsp; She ranged
some papers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you look?&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember your coming,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>He blinked with a new uneasiness; it might have begun to come to
him, through her difference, that he was somehow different himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were much quicker then, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So were you&mdash;you must do me that justice,&rdquo; she
answered with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;But let me see.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t
it Dover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Dolman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parade Lodge, Parade Terrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;thank you so awfully much!&rdquo;&nbsp; He began
to hope again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you <i>have</i> it&mdash;the other
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated afresh; she quite dangled him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
brought by a lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and she put in by mistake something wrong.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;ve got to get hold of!&rdquo;&nbsp; Heavens, what was
he going to say?&mdash;flooding poor Paddington with wild betrayals!&nbsp;
She couldn&rsquo;t too much, for her joy, dangle him, yet she couldn&rsquo;t
either, for his dignity, warn or control or check him.&nbsp; What she
found herself doing was just to treat herself to the middle way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was intercepted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It fell into the wrong hands.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s something
in it,&rdquo; he continued to blurt out, &ldquo;that <i>may</i> be all
right.&nbsp; That is, if it&rsquo;s wrong, don&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all right if it&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; he remarkably explained.</p>
<p>What <i>was</i> he, on earth, going to say?&nbsp; Mr. Buckton and
the counter-clerk were already interested; no one would have the decency
to come in; and she was divided between her particular terror for him
and her general curiosity.&nbsp; Yet she already saw with what brilliancy
she could add, to carry the thing off, a little false knowledge to all
her real.&nbsp; &ldquo;I quite understand,&rdquo; she said with benevolent,
with almost patronising quickness.&nbsp; &ldquo;The lady has forgotten
what she did put.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten most wretchedly, and it&rsquo;s an immense inconvenience.&nbsp;
It has only just been found that it didn&rsquo;t get there; so that
if we could immediately have it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every minute counts.&nbsp; You have,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;surely
got them on file?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that you can see it on the spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please&mdash;this very minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; The counter
rang with his knuckles, with the knob of his stick, with his panic of
alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do, <i>do</i> hunt it up!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say we could get it for you,&rdquo; the girl weetly
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get it?&rdquo;&mdash;he looked aghast.&nbsp; &ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably by to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;&mdash;his face was pitiful.</p>
<p>She caught only the uncovered gleams that peeped out of the blackness,
and she wondered what complication, even among the most supposable,
the very worst, could be bad enough to account for the degree of his
terror.&nbsp; There were twists and turns, there were places where the
screw drew blood, that she couldn&rsquo;t guess.&nbsp; She was more
and more glad she didn&rsquo;t want to.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been sent
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know if you don&rsquo;t look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a smile that was meant to be, in the absolute irony
of its propriety, quite divine.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was August 23rd, and
we&rsquo;ve nothing later here than August 27th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something leaped into his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;27th&mdash;23rd?&nbsp;
Then you&rsquo;re sure?&nbsp; You know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt she scarce knew what&mdash;as if she might soon be pounced
upon for some lurid connexion with a scandal.&nbsp; It was the queerest
of all sensations, for she had heard, she had read, of these things,
and the wealth of her intimacy with them at Cocker&rsquo;s might be
supposed to have schooled and seasoned her.&nbsp; This particular one
that she had really quite lived with was, after all, an old story; yet
what it had been before was dim and distant beside the touch under which
she now winced.&nbsp; Scandal?&mdash;it had never been but a silly word.&nbsp;
Now it was a great tense surface, and the surface was somehow Captain
Everard&rsquo;s wonderful face.&nbsp; Deep down in his eyes a picture,
a scene&mdash;a great place like a chamber of justice, where, before
a watching crowd, a poor girl, exposed but heroic, swore with a quavering
voice to a document, proved an <i>alibi</i>, supplied a link.&nbsp;
In this picture she bravely took her place.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the
23rd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then can&rsquo;t you get it this morning&mdash;or some time
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered, still holding him with her look, which she then turned
on her two companions, who were by this time unreservedly enlisted.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;not a scrap, and she glanced about for a
piece of paper.&nbsp; With this she had to recognise the rigour of official
thrift&mdash;a morsel of blackened blotter was the only loose paper
to be seen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you got a card?&rdquo; she said to her
visitor.&nbsp; He was quite away from Paddington now, and the next instant,
pocket-book in hand, he had whipped a card out.&nbsp; She gave no glance
at the name on it&mdash;only turned it to the other side.&nbsp; She
continued to hold him, she felt at present, as she had never held him;
and her command of her colleagues was for the moment not less marked.&nbsp;
She wrote something on the back of the card and pushed it across to
him.</p>
<p>He fairly glared at it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seven, nine, four&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine, six, one&rdquo;&mdash;she obligingly completed the number.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it right?&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>He took the whole thing in with a flushed intensity; then there broke
out in him a visibility of relief that was simply a tremendous exposure.&nbsp;
He shone at them all like a tall lighthouse, embracing even, for sympathy,
the blinking young men.&nbsp; &ldquo;By all the powers&mdash;it&rsquo;s
<i>wrong</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; And without another look, without a word
of thanks, without time for anything or anybody, he turned on them the
broad back of his great stature, straightened his triumphant shoulders,
and strode out of the place.</p>
<p>She was left confronted with her habitual critics.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;If
it&rsquo;s wrong it&rsquo;s all right!&rsquo;&rdquo; she extravagantly
quoted to them.</p>
<p>The counter-clerk was really awe-stricken.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how did
you know, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remembered, love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Buckton, on the contrary, was rude.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what game
is that, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No happiness she had ever known came within miles of it, and some
minutes elapsed before she could recall herself sufficiently to reply
that it was none of his business.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>If life at Cocker&rsquo;s, with the dreadful drop of August, had
lost something of its savour, she had not been slow to infer that a
heavier blight had fallen on the graceful industry of Mrs. Jordan.</p>
<p>With Lord Rye and Lady Ventnor and Mrs. Bubb all out of town, with
the blinds down on all the homes of luxury, this ingenious woman might
well have found her wonderful taste left quite on her hands.&nbsp; She
bore up, however, in a way that began by exciting much of her young
friend&rsquo;s esteem; they perhaps even more frequently met as the
wine of life flowed less free from other sources, and each, in the lack
of better diversion, carried on with more mystification for the other
an intercourse that consisted not a little in peeping out and drawing
back.&nbsp; Each waited for the other to commit herself, each profusely
curtained for the other the limits of low horizons.&nbsp; Mrs. Jordan
was indeed probably the more reckless skirmisher; nothing could exceed
her frequent incoherence unless it was indeed her occasional bursts
of confidence.&nbsp; Her account of her private affairs rose and fell
like a flame in the wind&mdash;sometimes the bravest bonfire and sometimes
a handful of ashes.&nbsp; This our young woman took to be an effect
of the position, at one moment and another, of the famous door of the
great world.&nbsp; She had been struck in one of her ha&rsquo;penny
volumes with the translation of a French proverb according to which
such a door, any door, had to be either open or shut; and it seemed
part of the precariousness of Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s life that hers mostly
managed to be neither.&nbsp; There had been occasions when it appeared
to gape wide&mdash;fairly to woo her across its threshold; there had
been others, of an order distinctly disconcerting, when it was all but
banged in her face.&nbsp; On the whole, however, she had evidently not
lost heart; these still belonged to the class of things in spite of
which she looked well.&nbsp; She intimated that the profits of her trade
had swollen so as to float her through any state of the tide, and she
had, besides this, a hundred profundities and explanations.</p>
<p>She rose superior, above all, on the happy fact that there were always
gentlemen in town and that gentlemen were her greatest admirers; gentlemen
from the City in especial&mdash;as to whom she was full of information
about the passion and pride excited in such breasts by the elements
of her charming commerce.&nbsp; The City men did in short go in for
flowers.&nbsp; There was a certain type of awfully smart stockbroker&mdash;Lord
Rye called them Jews and bounders, but she didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;whose
extravagance, she more than once threw out, had really, if one had any
conscience, to be forcibly restrained.&nbsp; It was not perhaps a pure
love of beauty: it was a matter of vanity and a sign of business; they
wished to crush their rivals, and that was one of their weapons.&nbsp;
Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s shrewdness was extreme; she knew in any case her
customer&mdash;she dealt, as she said, with all sorts; and it was at
the worst a race for her&mdash;a race even in the dull months&mdash;from
one set of chambers to another.&nbsp; And then, after all, there were
also still the ladies; the ladies of stockbroking circles were perpetually
up and down.&nbsp; They were not quite perhaps Mrs. Bubb or Lady Ventnor;
but you couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference unless you quarrelled with
them, and then you knew it only by their making-up sooner.&nbsp; These
ladies formed the branch of her subject on which she most swayed in
the breeze; to that degree that her confidant had ended with an inference
or two tending to banish regret for opportunities not embraced.&nbsp;
There were indeed tea-gowns that Mrs. Jordan described&mdash;but tea-gowns
were not the whole of respectability, and it was odd that a clergyman&rsquo;s
widow should sometimes speak as if she almost thought so.&nbsp; She
came back, it was true, unfailingly to Lord Rye, never, evidently, quite
losing sight of him even on the longest excursions.&nbsp; That he was
kindness itself had become in fact the very moral it all pointed&mdash;pointed
in strange flashes of the poor woman&rsquo;s nearsighted eyes.&nbsp;
She launched at her young friend portentous looks, solemn heralds of
some extraordinary communication.&nbsp; The communication itself, from
week to week, hung fire; but it was to the facts over which it hovered
that she owed her power of going on.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are, in one way
and another,&rdquo; she often emphasised, &ldquo;a tower of strength&rdquo;;
and as the allusion was to the aristocracy the girl could quite wonder
why, if they were so in &ldquo;one way,&rdquo; they should require to
be so in two.&nbsp; She thoroughly knew, however, how many ways Mrs.
Jordan counted in.&nbsp; It all meant simply that her fate was pressing
her close.&nbsp; If that fate was to be sealed at the matrimonial altar
it was perhaps not remarkable that she shouldn&rsquo;t come all at once
to the scratch of overwhelming a mere telegraphist.&nbsp; It would necessarily
present to such a person a prospect of regretful sacrifice.&nbsp; Lord
Rye&mdash;if it <i>was</i> Lord Rye&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;kind&rdquo;
to a nonentity of that sort, even though people quite as good had been.</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon in November they went, by arrangement, to church
together; after which&mdash;on the inspiration of the moment the arrangement
had not included it&mdash;they proceeded to Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s lodging
in the region of Maida Vale.&nbsp; She had raved to her friend about
her service of predilection; she was excessively &ldquo;high,&rdquo;
and had more than once wished to introduce the girl to the same comfort
and privilege.&nbsp; There was a thick brown fog and Maida Vale tasted
of acrid smoke; but they had been sitting among chants and incense and
wonderful music, during which, though the effect of such things on her
mind was great, our young lady had indulged in a series of reflexions
but indirectly related to them.&nbsp; One of these was the result of
Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s having said to her on the way, and with a certain
fine significance, that Lord Rye had been for some time in town.&nbsp;
She had spoken as if it were a circumstance to which little required
to be added&mdash;as if the bearing of such an item on her life might
easily be grasped.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the wonder of whether Lord Rye
wished to marry her that made her guest, with thoughts straying to that
quarter, quite determine that some other nuptials also should take place
at Saint Julian&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. Mudge was still an attendant at his
Wesleyan chapel, but this was the least of her worries&mdash;it had
never even vexed her enough for her to so much as name it to Mrs. Jordan.&nbsp;
Mr. Mudge&rsquo;s form of worship was one of several things&mdash;they
made up in superiority and beauty for what they wanted in number&mdash;that
she had long ago settled he should take from her, and she had now moreover
for the first time definitely established her own.&nbsp; Its principal
feature was that it was to be the same as that of Mrs. Jordan and Lord
Rye; which was indeed very much what she said to her hostess as they
sat together later on.&nbsp; The brown fog was in this hostess&rsquo;s
little parlour, where it acted as a postponement of the question of
there being, besides, anything else than the teacups and a pewter pot
and a very black little fire and a paraffin lamp without a shade.&nbsp;
There was at any rate no sign of a flower; it was not for herself Mrs.
Jordan gathered sweets.&nbsp; The girl waited till they had had a cup
of tea&mdash;waited for the announcement that she fairly believed her
friend had, this time, possessed herself of her formally at last to
make; but nothing came, after the interval, save a little poke at the
fire, which was like the clearing of a throat for a speech.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think you must have heard me speak of Mr. Drake?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Jordan had never looked so queer, nor her smile so suggestive of
a large benevolent bite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Drake?&nbsp; Oh yes; isn&rsquo;t he a friend of Lord Rye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great and trusted friend.&nbsp; Almost&mdash;I may say&mdash;a
loved friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s &ldquo;almost&rdquo; had such an oddity that
her companion was moved, rather flippantly perhaps, to take it up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t people as good as love their friends when they I
trust them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It pulled up a little the eulogist of Mr. Drake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
my dear, I love <i>you</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t trust me?&rdquo; the girl unmercifully
asked.</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Jordan paused&mdash;still she looked queer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
she replied with a certain austerity; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s exactly what
I&rsquo;m about to give you rather a remarkable proof of.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The sense of its being remarkable was already so strong that, while
she bridled a little, this held her auditor in a momentary muteness
of submission.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Drake has rendered his lordship for
several years services that his lordship has highly appreciated and
that make it all the more&mdash;a&mdash;unexpected that they should,
perhaps a little suddenly, separate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Separate?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our young lady was mystified, but she
tried to be interested; and she already saw that she had put the saddle
on the wrong horse.&nbsp; She had heard something of Mr. Drake, who
was a member of his lordship&rsquo;s circle&mdash;the member with whom,
apparently, Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s avocations had most happened to throw
her.&nbsp; She was only a little puzzled at the &ldquo;separation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, at any rate,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;if they separate
as friends&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh his lordship takes the greatest interest in Mr. Drake&rsquo;s
future.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll do anything for him; he has in fact just done
a great deal.&nbsp; There <i>must</i>, you know, be changes&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows it better than I,&rdquo; the girl said.&nbsp;
She wished to draw her interlocutress out.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will be
changes enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving Cocker&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ornament of that establishment waited a moment to answer, and
then it was indirect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me what <i>you&rsquo;re</i>
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what will you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that you&rsquo;ve found the opening you were always so
sure of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan, on this, appeared to muse with embarrassed intensity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was always sure, yes&mdash;and yet I often wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;re sure now.&nbsp; Sure, I mean, of
Mr. Drake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I think I may say I <i>am</i>.&nbsp; I kept
him going till I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My very own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice!&nbsp; And awfully rich?&rdquo; our young woman went
on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan showed promptly enough that she loved for higher things.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Awfully handsome&mdash;six foot two.&nbsp; And he <i>has</i>
put by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite like Mr. Mudge, then!&rdquo; that gentleman&rsquo;s
friend rather desperately exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh not quite!&rdquo; Mr. Drake&rsquo;s was ambiguous about
it, but the name of Mr. Mudge had evidently given her some sort of stimulus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have more opportunity now, at any rate.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
going to Lady Bradeen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Lady Bradeen?&rdquo;&nbsp; This was bewilderment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Going&mdash;&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had seen, from the way Mrs. Jordan looked at her, that the
effect of the name had been to make her let something out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She floundered, but she found her feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll
remember I&rsquo;ve often told you that if you&rsquo;ve grand clients
I have them too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jordan; &ldquo;but the great difference
is that you hate yours, whereas I really love mine.&nbsp; <i>Do</i>
you know Lady Bradeen?&rdquo; she pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down to the ground!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s always in and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s foolish eyes confessed, in fixing themselves
on this sketch, to a degree of wonder and even of envy.&nbsp; But she
bore up and, with a certain gaiety, &ldquo;Do you hate <i>her</i>?&rdquo;
she demanded.</p>
<p>Her visitor&rsquo;s reply was prompt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear no!&mdash;not
nearly so much as some of them.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s too outrageously beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan continued to gaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;Outrageously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; deliciously.&rdquo;&nbsp; What was really delicious
was Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s vagueness.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
her&mdash;you&rsquo;ve not seen her?&rdquo; her guest lightly continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve heard a great deal about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I!&rdquo; our young lady exclaimed.</p>
<p>Jordan looked an instant as if she suspected her good faith, or at
least her seriousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know some friend&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Lady Bradeen&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Oh yes&mdash;I know one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only one&mdash;but he&rsquo;s
so intimate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan just hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s not a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her interlocutress appeared to muse.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s immensely
surrounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>will</i> be&mdash;with Mr. Drake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s gaze became strangely fixed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
she <i>very</i> good-looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The handsomest person I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan continued to brood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I know some beauties.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then with her odd jerkiness: &ldquo;Do you think she looks <i>good</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s not always the case with the good-looking?&rdquo;&mdash;the
other took it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, indeed, it isn&rsquo;t: that&rsquo;s
one thing Cocker&rsquo;s has taught me.&nbsp; Still, there are some
people who have everything.&nbsp; Lady Bradeen, at any rate, has enough:
eyes and a nose and a mouth, a complexion, a figure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A figure?&rdquo; Mrs. Jordan almost broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A figure, a head of hair!&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl made a little
conscious motion that seemed to let the hair all down, and her companion
watched the wonderful show.&nbsp; &ldquo;But Mr. Drake <i>is</i> another&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s thoughts had to
come back from a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of her ladyship&rsquo;s admirers.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s &lsquo;going,&rsquo;
you say, to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Mrs. Jordan really faltered.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has engaged
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged him?&rdquo;&mdash;our young woman was quite at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same capacity as Lord Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was Lord Rye engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>Mrs. Jordan looked away from her now&mdash;looked, she thought, rather
injured and, as if trifled with, even a little angry.&nbsp; The mention
of Lady Bradeen had frustrated for a while the convergence of our heroine&rsquo;s
thoughts; but with this impression of her old friend&rsquo;s combined
impatience and diffidence they began again to whirl round her, and continued
it till one of them appeared to dart at her, out of the dance, as if
with a sharp peck.&nbsp; It came to her with a lively shock, with a
positive sting, that Mr. Drake was&mdash;could it be possible?&nbsp;
With the idea she found herself afresh on the edge of laughter, of a
sudden and strange perversity of mirth.&nbsp; Mr. Drake loomed, in a
swift image, before her; such a figure as she had seen in open doorways
of houses in Cocker&rsquo;s quarter&mdash;majestic, middle-aged, erect,
flanked on either side by a footman and taking the name of a visitor.&nbsp;
Mr. Drake then verily <i>was</i> a person who opened the door!&nbsp;
Before she had time, however, to recover from the effect of her evocation,
she was offered a vision which quite engulfed it.&nbsp; It was communicated
to her somehow that the face with which she had seen it rise prompted
Mrs. Jordan to dash, a bit wildly, at something, at anything, that might
attenuate criticism.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Bradeen&rsquo;s re-arranging&mdash;she&rsquo;s
going to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl echoed it ever so softly, but
there it was at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She summoned all her sturdiness.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, she hasn&rsquo;t
told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And her friends&mdash;haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any of them lately.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
so fortunate as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan gathered herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t
even heard of Lord Bradeen&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her comrade, unable for a moment to speak, gave a slow headshake.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know it from Mr. Drake?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was better surely
not to learn things at all than to learn them by the butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tells him everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he tells <i>you</i>&mdash;I see.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our young
lady got up; recovering her muff and her gloves she smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
I haven&rsquo;t unfortunately any Mr. Drake.&nbsp; I congratulate you
with all my heart.&nbsp; Even without your sort of assistance, however,
there&rsquo;s a trifle here and there that I do pick up.&nbsp; I gather
that if she&rsquo;s to marry any one it must quite necessarily be my
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan was now also on her feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is Captain Everard
your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl considered, drawing on a glove.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw, at one
time, an immense deal of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan looked hard at the glove, but she hadn&rsquo;t after
all waited for that to be sorry it wasn&rsquo;t cleaner.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
time was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been the time you were seeing so much of Mr.
Drake.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had now fairly taken it in: the distinguished
person Mrs. Jordan was to marry would answer bells and put on coals
and superintend, at least, the cleaning of boots for the other distinguished
person whom she might&mdash;well, whom she might have had, if she had
wished, so much more to say to.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she added;
&ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan, however, again taking her muff from her, turned it over,
brushed it off and thoughtfully peeped into it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me
this before you go.&nbsp; You spoke just now of your own changes.&nbsp;
Do you mean that Mr. Mudge&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mudge has had great patience with me&mdash;he has brought
me at last to the point.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re to be married next month
and have a nice little home.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s only a grocer, you
know&rdquo;&mdash;the girl met her friend&rsquo;s intent eyes&mdash;&ldquo;so
that I&rsquo;m afraid that, with the set you&rsquo;ve got into, you
won&rsquo;t see your way to keep up our friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan for a moment made no answer to this; she only held the
muff up to her face, after which she gave it back.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; I see, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her guest&rsquo;s astonishment there were tears now in her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like what?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why my engagement.&nbsp; Only, with your great cleverness,&rdquo;
the poor lady quavered out, &ldquo;you put it in your own way.&nbsp;
I mean that you&rsquo;ll cool off.&nbsp; You already have&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And on this, the next instant, her tears began to flow.&nbsp; She succumbed
to them and collapsed; she sank down again, burying her face and trying
to smother her sobs.</p>
<p>Her young friend stood there, still in some rigour, but taken much
by surprise even if not yet fully moved to pity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
put anything in any &lsquo;way,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m very glad you&rsquo;re
suited.&nbsp; Only, you know, you did put to me so splendidly what,
even for me, if I had listened to you, it might lead to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan kept up a mild thin weak wail; then, drying her eyes,
as feebly considered this reminder.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has led to my not
starving!&rdquo; she faintly gasped.</p>
<p>Our young lady, at this, dropped into the place beside her, and now,
in a rush, the small silly misery was clear.&nbsp; She took her hand
as a sign of pitying it, then, after another instant, confirmed this
expression with a consoling kiss.&nbsp; They sat there together; they
looked out, hand in hand, into the damp dusky shabby little room and
into the future, of no such very different suggestion, at last accepted
by each.&nbsp; There was no definite utterance, on either side, of Mr.
Drake&rsquo;s position in the great world, but the temporary collapse
of his prospective bride threw all further necessary light; and what
our heroine saw and felt for in the whole business was the vivid reflexion
of her own dreams and delusions and her own return to reality.&nbsp;
Reality, for the poor things they both were, could only be ugliness
and obscurity, could never be the escape, the rise.&nbsp; She pressed
her friend&mdash;she had tact enough for that&mdash;with no other personal
question, brought on no need of further revelations, only just continued
to hold and comfort her and to acknowledge by stiff little forbearances
the common element in their fate.&nbsp; She felt indeed magnanimous
in such matters; since if it was very well, for condolence or reassurance,
to suppress just then invidious shrinkings, she yet by no means saw
herself sitting down, as she might say, to the same table with Mr. Drake.&nbsp;
There would luckily, to all appearance, be little question of tables;
and the circumstance that, on their peculiar lines, her friend&rsquo;s
interests would still attach themselves to Mayfair flung over Chalk
Farm the first radiance it had shown.&nbsp; Where was one&rsquo;s pride
and one&rsquo;s passion when the real way to judge of one&rsquo;s luck
was by making not the wrong but the right comparison?&nbsp; Before she
had again gathered herself to go she felt very small and cautious and
thankful.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall have our own house,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and you must come very soon and let me show it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i> shall have our own too,&rdquo; Mrs. Jordan replied;
&ldquo;for, don&rsquo;t you know? he makes it a condition that he sleeps
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A condition?&rdquo;&mdash;the girl felt out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For any new position.&nbsp; It was on that he parted with
Lord Rye.&nbsp; His lordship can&rsquo;t meet it.&nbsp; So Mr. Drake
has given him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all for you?&rdquo;&mdash;our young woman put it as cheerfully
as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me and Lady Bradeen.&nbsp; Her ladyship&rsquo;s too glad
to get him at any price.&nbsp; Lord Rye, out of interest in us, has
in fact quite <i>made</i> her take him.&nbsp; So, as I tell you, he
will have his own establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan, in the elation of it, had begun to revive; but there
was nevertheless between them rather a conscious pause&mdash;a pause
in which neither visitor nor hostess brought out a hope or an invitation.&nbsp;
It expressed in the last resort that, in spite of submission and sympathy,
they could now after all only look at each other across the social gulf.&nbsp;
They remained together as if it would be indeed their last chance, still
sitting, though awkwardly, quite close, and feeling also&mdash;and this
most unmistakeably&mdash;that there was one thing more to go into.&nbsp;
By the time it came to the surface, moreover, our young friend had recognised
the whole of the main truth, from which she even drew again a slight
irritation.&nbsp; It was not the main truth perhaps that most signified;
but after her momentary effort, her embarrassment and her tears Mrs.
Jordan had begun to sound afresh&mdash;and even without speaking&mdash;the
note of a social connexion.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t really let go of
it that she was marrying into society.&nbsp; Well, it was a harmless
compensation, and it was all the prospective bride of Mr. Mudge had
to leave with her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>This young lady at last rose again, but she lingered before going.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And has Captain Everard nothing to say to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to such questions&mdash;the domestic arrangements, things
in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he, with any authority, when nothing in the house
is his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not his?&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl wondered, perfectly conscious
of the appearance she thus conferred on Mrs. Jordan of knowing, in comparison
with herself, so tremendously much about it.&nbsp; Well, there were
things she wanted so to get at that she was willing at last, though
it hurt her, to pay for them with humiliation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are
they not his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, dear, that he has nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was hard to see him in such a light,
but Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s power to answer for it had a superiority that
began, on the spot, to grow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he rich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan looked immensely, looked both generally and particularly,
informed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It depends upon what you call&mdash;!&nbsp; Not
at any rate in the least as she is.&nbsp; What does he bring?&nbsp;
Think what she has.&nbsp; And then, love, his debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His debts?&rdquo;&nbsp; His young friend was fairly betrayed
into helpless innocence.&nbsp; She could struggle a little, but she
had to let herself go; and if she had spoken frankly she would have
said: &ldquo;Do tell me, for I don&rsquo;t know so much about him as
<i>that</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; As she didn&rsquo;t speak frankly she only
said: &ldquo;His debts are nothing&mdash;when she so adores him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan began to fix her again, and now she saw that she must
only take it all.&nbsp; That was what it had come to: his having sat
with her there on the bench and under the trees in the summer darkness
and put his hand on her, making her know what he would have said if
permitted; his having returned to her afterwards, repeatedly, with supplicating
eyes and a fever in his blood; and her having, on her side, hard and
pedantic, helped by some miracle and with her impossible condition,
only answered him, yet supplicating back, through the bars of the cage,&mdash;all
simply that she might hear of him, now for ever lost, only through Mrs.
Jordan, who touched him through Mr. Drake, who reached him through Lady
Bradeen.&nbsp; &ldquo;She adores him&mdash;but of course that wasn&rsquo;t
all there was about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl met her eyes a minute, then quite surrendered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
was there else about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Jordan was almost
compassionate.</p>
<p>Her interlocutress had, in the cage, sounded depths, but there was
a suggestion here somehow of an abyss quite measureless.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course I know she would never let him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>could</i> she&mdash;fancy!&mdash;when he had so compromised
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most artless cry they had ever uttered broke, at this, from the
younger pair of lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Had</i> he so&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know the scandal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our heroine thought, recollected there was something, whatever it
was, that she knew after all much more of than Mrs. Jordan.&nbsp; She
saw him again as she had seen him come that morning to recover the telegram&mdash;she
saw him as she had seen him leave the shop.&nbsp; She perched herself
a moment on this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh there was nothing public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly public&mdash;no.&nbsp; But there was an awful
scare and an awful row.&nbsp; It was all on the very point of coming
out.&nbsp; Something was lost&mdash;something was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; the girl replied, smiling as if with the revival
of a blurred memory; &ldquo;something was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all got about&mdash;and there was a point at which Lord
Bradeen had to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to&mdash;yes.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan was obliged to admit it.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
And then, luckily for them, he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know about his death,&rdquo; her companion
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nine weeks ago, and most sudden.&nbsp; It has given
them a prompt chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get married?&rdquo;&mdash;this was a wonder&mdash;&ldquo;within
nine weeks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh not immediately, but&mdash;in all the circumstances&mdash;very
quietly and, I assure you, very soon.&nbsp; Every preparation&rsquo;s
made.&nbsp; Above all she holds him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, she holds him!&rdquo; our young friend threw off.&nbsp;
She had this before her again a minute; then she continued: &ldquo;You
mean through his having made her talked about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not only that.&nbsp; She has still another pull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, he was <i>in</i> something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her comrade wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;In what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Something bad.&nbsp; As I tell you,
something was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been very bad for him.&nbsp; But, she helped
him some way&mdash;she recovered it, got hold of it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
even said she stole it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young woman considered afresh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why it was what was
found that precisely saved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan, however, was positive.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&nbsp;
I happen to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her disciple faltered but an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean through
Mr. Drake?&nbsp; Do they tell him these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good servant,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jordan, now thoroughly superior
and proportionately sententious, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t need to be told!&nbsp;
Her ladyship saved&mdash;as a woman so often saves!&mdash;the man she
loves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time our heroine took longer to recover herself, but she found
a voice at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah well&mdash;of course I don&rsquo;t
know!&nbsp; The great thing was that he got off.&nbsp; They seem then,
in a manner,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;to have done a great deal for
each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s she that has done most.&nbsp; She has him
tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I see.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; The women had already
embraced, and this was not repeated; but Mrs. Jordan went down with
her guest to the door of the house.&nbsp; Here again the younger lingered,
reverting, though three or four other remarks had on the way passed
between them, to Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
you mean just now that if she hadn&rsquo;t saved him, as you call it,
she wouldn&rsquo;t hold him so tight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dare say.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Jordan, on the doorstep,
smiled with a reflexion that had come to her; she took one of her big
bites of the brown gloom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Men always dislike one when they&rsquo;ve
done one an injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what injury had he done her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one I&rsquo;ve mentioned.&nbsp; He <i>must</i> marry her,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t he want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before she recovered the telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan was pulled up a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it a telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you said so.&nbsp; I mean
whatever it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, whatever it was, I don&rsquo;t think she saw <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she just nailed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She just nailed him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The departing friend was
now at the bottom of the little flight of steps; the other was at the
top, with a certain thickness of fog.&nbsp; &ldquo;And when am I to
think of you in your little home?&mdash;next month?&rdquo; asked the
voice from the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the very latest.&nbsp; And when am I to think of you in
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh even sooner.&nbsp; I feel, after so much talk with you
about it, as if I were already there!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then &ldquo;<i>Good</i>-bye!&rdquo;
came out of the fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-<i>bye</i>!&rdquo; went into it.&nbsp; Our young lady
went into it also, in the opposed quarter, and presently, after a few
sightless turns, came out on the Paddington canal.&nbsp; Distinguishing
vaguely what the low parapet enclosed she stopped close to it and stood
a while very intently, but perhaps still sightlessly, looking down on
it.&nbsp; A policeman; while she remained, strolled past her; then,
going his way a little further and half lost in the atmosphere, paused
and watched her.&nbsp; But she was quite unaware&mdash;she was full
of her thoughts.&nbsp; They were too numerous to find a place just here,
but two of the number may at least be mentioned.&nbsp; One of these
was that, decidedly, her little home must be not for next month, but
for next week; the other, which came indeed as she resumed her walk
and went her way, was that it was strange such a matter should be at
last settled for her by Mr. Drake</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
