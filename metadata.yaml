description: Long recognized as one of the most refined and insightful American writers
  of the nineteenth century, Henry James turns his keen powers of perception and observation
  to the case of a London telegraph operator in the novella In the Cage. Over time,
  the operator becomes adept at inferring personal details from customers' messages
  and develops an unhealthy interest in the quotidian lives of those she serves. A
  masterpiece of psychological subtlety, In the Cage is a must-read for fans of James'
  work.
